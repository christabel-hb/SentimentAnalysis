973,972,raja,bhai vo netfilx h  vo kharid sakta h 
974,973,roshan surve,my point is the change is inevitable it has happened in the past like this multiplex over took the business of single screen owners plus people are tired of paying excess amount obrfor items such as snacks even water there should be some limit for such pricing or else it might get into peoples movement but yes the effect of watching movies like avengers might get lost has its merits and demerits
975,974,Rajni,ott paltform is mainly vulagr content dekhne ke liye hi use kiya jata h

981,980,POKE--------LEGEND,telegram  have all
982,981,Vandana Prasad,sir this is a very serious topic that is affecting crores of people at the same time i am glad you made a video on this coming to the topic i think there are several facitrd responsible for the growth of the ott platforms content being one and the most important of them the second point that i would want to add is the length of the series  if one is watching a series ott platforms generally have a limited episode series which enables people to finish it at a stretch without elongating it for years and years as is the trend of the major tv channels in india i dont know if you can relate or not but the youth in india was fairly disturbed by the amount of  never ending saas bahu content and crap comedy that is put out on our television sets in the name of entertainment with no regard to the current changing mindsets of people or the modern lifestyle people  especially youth needed a change and the ott platforms brought a much sought after revolution the quality and the variation  of content that can be seen on these platforms is mindblowing also it is giving opportunity to a lot of creators to put out rich content without grand budgets a series could be shot on a phone properly with a good story and could grab a place on these platforms thoughi would agree that this platform has its own demerits one being it is very addictive the amount of nudity has only increased if anything and seems to have been surpassed the movie levels maybe due to less censorship here also this has made people a lot more glued to the screens often leading to discontent in social relationships after indulging in this as people start expecting the same dopamine  and adrenaline rush in their real life as in the reel which does not usually happen brbrall i would say is that usage of every platform needs discretionand this is no exception
983,982,Sudeep Jaiswal,movies first release in theatare than release on ott  platform  theatare se bahot jyada logo ko rojgar milta hain theatare must be first priority for evreyone

1290,1289,Riicho Bamin, kumar i have seen it there is nothing wrong with it what ever mr aghnihotri said he said what he thought was the truth he never said anything seditious
1291,1290,Akash Kumar, bamin really  sidhant agnihotri portrait sharjeel imam as an innocent person even though he knows what he did  sidhant try to misguide educated youth and fltry to fulfill his agenda

1357,1356,D K DEEP,netflix amazon prime video alt balaji telegram is best 
1358,1357,AT,both theatres and otts have their pros and cons however in the long run otts can win and their advantages outweigh their disadvantages brthe experience of watching a theatre cannot be replaced with a big screen and great visuals however otts are far more convenient and one can watch a movie multiple times
1359,1358,rajeev j,sir many ott platforms ullu alt balaji hotshots digital kooku etc  are spreading sexuality and being irresponsible in a relationship as a way to earn money and spoil youngsters they have already spoiled i think 
1360,1359,Hirdesh,govt is considering a policy to regulate their content
1361,1360,Shivmohan Singh,you are absolutely right
1362,1361,Shivmohan Singh,rajiv bhai you are absolutely right
1363,1362,Tridip Sarmah,bhai tvf is one of the best ott platform
1364,1363,Bally Sandhu,gandi baat

1366,1365,Niraj Kumar verma,your concern is absolutely true government must interfere on obscene content which is easily available on mobile phone thisll spoil our culture recognition
1367,1366,The EXAM INFO.,web series   sensor board     
1368,1367,08 Anish chand yadav,thats why they are rated can be compared to cancer warning on tobacco and alcoholbrwatching it is completely a choice and afyer effects also
1369,1368,anu,bhai fliz bhi he
1370,1369,Sridhar Rao,these apps are  and is strictly out of the range of kids so i dont think there is a problem with these content and lack of censorship is the only reason i watch netflix and prime
1371,1370,major singh, sandhu mastraam

1376,1375,triko marino,big stars and big theatersand bollywood monopoly getting destroyed hahahahaha
1377,1376,Sridhar Rao, nut aap mujhse sawal pooch rahi hain ya jawan de rahin hain lekin kya farak padtha hain agar bacche ise dekh bhi rahe hain tho lekin in apps ko access karnr ke liye credit ya debit card chahiye aur ek  saal se kam are ke baccho ke pass account hi nahi hota agar hota bhi hain to guardianguardian ki permission chahiye
1378,1377,Rahbar Raza,also hoichoi mx player

1382,1380,Natasha Barwa, trading hn yr ias log ka kya km
1383,1381,Nayan Ahirrao, rao you can easily download web series from web site by using vpn or sometimes without vpn
1384,1382,Hirdesh, khobaragade bro is freedom means nudity or soft porn censorship is not bad until it becomes ass of the ruling government there must be some regulation to stop inappropriate content however enough freedom should be given to content creators to showcase their talent we need to make balance between quality content and softporn uploaders
1385,1383,Amol Khobaragade, no you stop watching softporn and dont increase government control brpeople need to have a choice to what they want to watch you dont have to be a quality police of ott
1386,1384,Nayan Ahirrao, rao i think you lost your mind brmy comment is quotyou can easily download web series from web site by using vpn or sometimes without vpnquot
1387,1385,Sridhar Rao, ahirrao so what let them watch sorry i tagged you but it was actually meant for op
1388,1386,Nayan Ahirrao, rao ok brone thing censor board is not only for nudity
1389,1387,Sridhar Rao, ahirrao you know rang rasiya was a good movie but delayed for several years just because of a nude scene same for anurag kashyap movies like paanch and black friday i believe that its really hard to make movies in india especially for free thinkers
1390,1388,Sridhar Rao, ahirrao no
1391,1389,Nayan Ahirrao, rao black friday is not ban because of nudity brrang rasiya is fantasy based movie on real artist raja ravi verma you dont have any right to make movie on fantasies about real human
1392,1390,Sridhar Rao, ahirrao lol rang rasiya was a fantasy are you out of your mind it was banned because of the topless scene of the lead actress it did not represent the accurate life of raja ravi verma but that was not the reason the movie was banned do you think sanju represent the accurate life of sanjay duty but still movie did great at bo right  but black friday banned because of its objectionable content there was no nudity but my point is the censor board bans everything that it finds problematic there is too much power in their hand we are india not china where the govt controls everything the ott platforms does not have govt control thats why they have good shows but if that happens we will be watching the same old saas bahu shit
1393,1391,Nayan Ahirrao, rao but you dont have any right to make fantasy movie on real life person and also against religious sentimentsbrfilms are for entertainment not for creating problems in society and targeting any religion or group of people
1394,1392,Sridhar Rao, ahirrao so you are an extrimist hindu i knew it  i am a moderate hindu and even i have a problem when our movies and tv shows potray hindus as evil and vicious and muslims as victims but you have to understand these are just for the sake of entertainment while watching these shows and movies only thing i care is the quality of the show and nothing else if there are shows like sacred games pataal lok which demonise hindus there are also movies like padmaavat baahubali tanhaji etc which glorifies hindus so there is balance in both sides
1395,1393,Nayan Ahirrao, rao i am not extremist hindu i am talking about rang rasiya
1396,1394,Nayan Ahirrao, rao i am not talking about people i am talking about there faith i am against the criticism of faith bri will also react with same intensity if any director wrong portrait about muslim people faith
1397,1395,rajeev j, rao there is no story only sexuality and many stories generally encourage cheating  and having affairs and the videos are easily downloadable mx player and alt balaji is free the problem is the impact these will have on children why has it started from past few years arent these entertainment required few years earlier why now and this is not good as per many indian religions
1398,1396,Sridhar Rao, j people are  watching these shows for sex scenes only no one takes them seriously i used to watch sabita bhabhi when was a teenager but for comedy and sex scene only not for story
1399,1397,sanju pal,american media entertainment changed the world
1400,1398,sagar kb,fact is bollywood movies se jyada web series  earn kar rahi haibollywood movies to flop ho rahi hai

1445,1443,Sudarshan,entertainment is equally important
1446,1444,Avinash Kumar,aur sabse important study iq ko follow karo
1447,1445,Pak Phoren Minister,kyu bhai competition badha rahe ho oracle bhai let the poorer be poorer dont tell how to become rich and   people dominate the world thats interesting
1448,1446,Oracle, phoren minister bhai  me max indians hone chahiye jews ne kafi kar liya raaj 
1449,1447,Avinash Kumar, phoren minister very insensitive
1450,1448,Rohit, phoren minister bete asli competition to poor hi dete hai  rich peoples just enjoy their life with their fathers hard earned money 
1451,1449,Pak Phoren Minister,thats why is set an desire for  trillionare dollar net worth to construct the old way education to build nalanda and takshila university in every indian state to make the college so renowned that has much more value than harvard stanford make india great again and do you know ever the more than  people become more rich in country more troubles start you can see fall of babylon mohenjodaro if you want to make india great again till the sun exist try to conquer africa but no discrimination only with love and utilize all the potential they have and also serve then because they have so huge resource but no capability to utilize it as ghana is becoming populated with hindus try to create dominance and through action change the world
1452,1450,Pak Phoren Minister,nd the principle of  laws of power says never outshine the master so try to make the people look as they are more intellectual than us let them waste their time no need to change people mind its only make an argument and you know  in dale carnegie book its forbidden to have argument with anyone i think if you re enthusiast reader you might know already and only teach indian fellow this knowledge those who has hard core perseverance to habitualize and and to work on their goals and seem pretty funny never talk it about it in your school or colleges they will think you are fool by the way bye bye
1453,1451,Pak Phoren Minister, yeah true but in the form of strength and work but rich people know how to dominate the whole world if no then you may not know why   people dominate entire gdp of earth and yes you can gain any success at any path rich people sons fail because their parents try to give their son ultimate pleasure and cn you tell why not ambani failed and ratan tata failed in their business they are running now third generation go ahead with your strength and hardwork it can take you only being a labour who earn for daily wage and survival
1454,1452,Pak Phoren Minister,try to make most out of your life dont fail because if you have made youself financial knowledge then getting fail will break you u will be miserable some foolish dude said to fail to make no one follow their passage and challenge their dominance and i deliberately ask you why to make everyone rich they pay or what think what happens when everyone becomes rich no not possible it is not capable for people to do it yeah poor people has opportunity to become rich as they dont have nothing to lose as being a son of wealthy parents i never got the utilization of resources well i think middle class people has most interesting  life as they are allowed to go out and do whatever they want but we are enclosed in loop to make ur future more great and to led all the fellows to great heights

1553,1550,Praveen C J,cinema and its traditions will change with time amp technology big theatres were part of our social life past  years when technology was at its nascency and was costly now that has changed with the advancements in internet tech with g amp g and the cost of multimedia and highend digital technologies has become very affordable for families and individuals so now we can enjoy anything with the same effects and intensity at our own comforts at our own time the old concepts will change for good one should remember that quotchange is the only constantquot and the film field should understand and embrace it
1554,1551,Ashish Yadav,people will surely come to cinema but instead of only making spectacular movies you also need to increase the number of screens and also reduce price of food items in multiplex

1589,1586,Sahil Rajput,but our social media ruined it they just trolll almost everything related to one particular thing amp praise anything like never before amp it becomes overrated no one is forcing you to watch any film its your take that you want to watch it or not but trolling without even watching the film i understand the rush to films like race but they even trolled a rooted film like bharat without even watching it and the influence of social media generates the negative vibes

1597,1594,Vijay S,i also prefer theatre but an average person can watch maximum two movies per month in theatres due to this the person can watch some movies which heshe missed in theatres laterbras far as movies are concerned theatre movies can be blockbuster superhit hit or flop on one side they can earn huge money quickly and on the other side they can lose money but ott movies are neither hit nor flop and they earn money but slowly

1616,1613,Nona Prince,theaters i choose
1617,1614,Varun Saxena,galti badi galti nona princes bahubali  trailer reaction
1618,1615,scarface,bro you cant just counter the argument by saying that covid is going on everytime  argument should be about non covid times otherwise there cant be any argument as you can just say that but covid is going on  
1619,1616,Nona Prince, saxena 
1620,1617,Nona Prince, thats the main factor right covid has forced people to change their viewing habits we have no idea when everything will be back to normal or it ever will ott was going to be the future but in next  years but due to covid and  lockdown its now
1621,1618,धडाकेबाज,for content movies ott is bestfor mass movies and big budget hollywood movies theatre is bestdiscussion khatam
1622,1619,shamanth Ramachandra,as long as the theatre experience is as good as it is right now theatres wont go awayyou can listen to any song you want but still people go to concertssame concept
1623,1620,Nona Prince,point is would they now post covid
1624,1621,itsajin,i think an important point is the revenueprofit angle how much money does a producer make on ott vs theatres this is also important
1625,1622,Nona Prince,due to covid there is no way a film can make  cr in  week now so there is definite drop in box office ott is giving assured amount which most producers will be happy to have who have interests to pay
1626,1623,itsajin, prince oh yes in current covid environment ott is definitely a good option i was thinking long term
1627,1624,Nona Prince,but the extension of covid is changing the viewing habits of the people right we have no idea how long will it go like this and once people get habitual to ott ot will be very difficult to change it back
1628,1625,ayush patil,the first thing i do when i click your video is like your video you make lot more sense
1629,1626,Sayed Musthaqeem,yeahtruebranyway waiting for theatre to open
1630,1627,Adwaid Rajan,ya ott have a uplift when compared to theatre but i believe audience cannot get the same experience as they watching movie in theatre as compared to watch i ott platform even in the future big budget movie only get profit and get good experience only by watching in theatre in the future the numbers of movie produced will increase and movie release in theatre and within few weeks it will release in ott big budget movie demand theatrical experience so both ott and theatre will go hand in hand
1631,1628,Nona Prince,what about covid
1632,1629,scarface, prince we can maintain distance while wearing masks and avoiding to eat anything in theatre 
1633,1630,Nona Prince, not that simple theatres thrive on the food sales otherwise they will increase ticket prices than how many people can afford that
1634,1631,scarface, prince bro leave covid for moment say like  or  years from now 
1635,1632,scarface,because if you will include covid in all the replies it will be very hard to counter 
1636,1633,Nona Prince, thats the whole point of the video have seen the whole video brthe impact of lockdown has exposed how easy it is to consume content on home devices than going to a theatre the habit of viewing has changed in the past  months
1637,1634,scarface, prince going to theatre to watch movies is and will always be a better experience
1638,1635,Nona Prince,i know and i said that in the video too but reality doesnt always let you have the better experience we have to compromise
1639,1636,scarface, prince but corona will go away  this is temporary 
1640,1637,Nona Prince,i dont think so people were saying this  months back too even if it do go away by that time people viewing habits would have been changed to ott bringing them back will be quite impossible for theatres who are already in financial crisis
1641,1638,Andoga, points i want to addbrbr in us theater chains are starting to experiment with monthly plans also pay a monthly fee for a membership and you can watch  movie a daybrbr ott platforms are not that welcoming of new movie makers my cousin is in the business he wrote and produced a show for a tv channel when he approached netflix with a project they turned him down because there wasnt a quotfamous personquot in their team youtube also has new restrictions on enabling monetization
1642,1639,Aarush p,even though i have ott subscription brbut theatre cinema brescpeailly if a hollywood film comes i have to see it in theatre bralso superstar masalal films braudience need to see in theatre
1643,1640,Renny Daniel,great rundown nona i agree ott is the futurebrbrbut i will say ott is also becoming a monopoly a filmmaker friend and i were discussing creating something to release on netflix its  just to submit a film and then you dont know if netflix will approve or not you dont get your money back if they dont
1644,1641,Nona Prince,oh really its pretty different in india i have few friends eho have pitched there stories to them free of cost
1645,1642,Renny Daniel,i guess its different in india since they are really promoting india and trying to take over the indian market
1646,1643,Nona Prince, daniel definitely
1647,1644,Ya Tee,good contentbut i hope u will do more research and a longer video in futurebrregional cinema find it difficult to get a decent platform without big namesbrthe culture of using illegal platforms bras u saidto an extentott will be the futureso people involved should move onbrbut lets hope there will be movies made for theatre experiencebrbecause i want to cheer for a thaliva entrnce or when captain use mjolnir and experience nolan or ljp world  
1648,1645,Nona Prince,theatres will never die but will be exclusive to big films only brregarding the regional cinema as the audience grows for that market they get on internet platforms will go to them because there only goal is to bring more people on there platforms brif i can say what i want to in  mins than why to make a long video
1649,1646,Rahul B, prince ok on what basis will you decide this is big film amp this is small film  in malayalam even big stars act in small budget movie
1650,1647,Nona Prince, ba fi with big budget a list stars backed by big studios and is pitched as made for big screen epic
1651,1648,Rahul B, prince thats a wrong way to decide this movie is big amp small in malayalam big stars do act in small budget movie because the canvas required for that movie is small budget but still that small budget movie with a list actor make huge collections same way even in some of tamil amp kannada movies as well deciding the movie is big amp small on basis of budget amp a list actors is wrong way to look at it who would have thought arjun reddy new comer actor with medium budget would make such huge collections if arjun reddy had went directly for ott release im sure they would have been offered a small price amount
1652,1649,Nona Prince, b as i said big budget first plus big stars  bahubali bhansali movies superhero films fantasy adventure films etc which are made for big screen will be the only one successful at the bo
1653,1650,Rahul B, prince thats where you are wrong i believe in  making decisions based on budget amp star cast big budget big star cast always doesnt mean big collection in bo maybe what you are saying might be  true in hindi films but in south films except telugu big budget big star cast doesnt mean big bo you can find plenty of examples here where big budget big star cast barely made any collection and same way you can find plenty of examples with small budget with one or two movies old actors making huge collections in bo
1654,1651,Nona Prince,we were talking about big films taking over box office what you consider big or small is for you to decide but the way its looked in the market is  big hero film made for big screen these films will only be able to bring audience to theatres and only they will get screens in cinemas small films have no chance and they will only have ott because ppl would prefer watching them at home
1655,1652,Pratheesh R,nonot at allott platform producers wont get much money as compared to theatrebcz as you said the producer can only make a secured profit it is a bargaining profit in ott the issue is going to happen with ott the providers will be the producers of all the films in their platform called originalsquot and cant compare theatre vs ott for viewing experience the feel and experience are totally different going outwatching moviehaving food some shopping its cool right
1656,1653,Nona Prince,i think what you are not taking into consideration is covid i dont think that even vijays master can do  cr in the next  months to  year some sources say amazon offered  cr for the rights as i said in the video going for a film is a  hrs affair today many people cannot afford it due to financial reasons as well as health precautions the majority of the film audience is family audiences they will not risk their old parents or young kids and reports show that even young people can get affected would you chose to risk all and watch it in theatre or stay home in comfort of your house in safety and watch it ok your tv laptop or mobile
1657,1654,Aarush p,but viajy declined the offer brand told he will never release his film in theatrebrbut suriya film sooroi potru is coming on oct  right
1658,1655,Filmies Forever,watching a movie in theatre is un matchableiam still waiting for th reopening of theatres expecting it will happening soon
1659,1656,Rahul B,nona waiting for kannada movie review brrama rama re  road drama  free on youtube with english subtitles
1660,1657,Rahul B,first of all theatres making money soley on selling popcorn amp other eatable items is not true they do make lot of money through selling tickets too how much they make  this thing varies from state to state movie to movie  but as far as i know theatres do make quite lot of money in a listers movie even though movie is not good in south india what i have heard theatres do make quite lot of money especially in a listers movie and producers get their investment back within  weeks of good run in theatres in a listers movie but thats not the case in most of good content small movies so here ott gives a confidence for small movie makers a to get their returns backbrbrott is safe bet for small movies but big budget movie releasing it only on ott platform not in theatres is big loss for producers amp many others thats why many of big tamil movies though they have completed shoot almost are waiting for theatres to reopen as far as south indian audiences they  enjoy their favourite actors movie much more in theatres not in any  ott platform
1661,1658,Nona Prince,i said that most of the quotprofitsquot come from selling food they break even the expense of a single show through the tickets sold a big film definitely boost there income that is why a big star film gets more screens you also have to take the taxes  the rent the multiplexes pay etc
1662,1659,Rahul B, prince  from ott what is good is producers get some relief that if their movie dont do well in theatres be it any big  commerical movie or small good content movie that they will get their investment back pre ott platform this was not the case producers soley relied upon on theatres amp tv rights all in all ott is good for any producers
1663,1660,Nona Prince, b thats my point
1664,1661,Rahul B, prince brbig commercial movie  good theatre run ott bonus for producersbrbig commercial movie  bad or average theatre run ott covers up loss  brbig commercial movie  no theatres run due to lockdown amp releasing it only on ott platform is bad for producers since he may or may not  get back his investment back sometimes producers has to sell below price of his investment due to this bad circumstancesbrbrsmall content movie  good theatre run ott is bonus for producerbrsmall content movie  bad or average theatre run covers up loss of producersbrsmall content movie  releasing it only on ott platform not in theatres depends on for how much producer sold it for for example  bheemasena nalamaharaj kannada movie is small budget content movie producer didnt get good offer from any of  ott platform so producer is waiting for theatres to reopen brbrat lastbrwhat we call tell is soley relying upon on ott is bad for any producers theatre  ott is good for all of us even for audience to get that experience

1675,1672,Manoj Mallick,theater experience cant take ott platform
1676,1673,ANHONEE TADAP,basic youtube is the best becoz it is free with every type of content 
1677,1674,rajesh kumar,now a days people are having home theaters for the same reason and in no time there will be more growth in digitalizing home theaters in such a way that they have the true cinematic experience in their home itself this is will start a new era where people will stop completely coming to theaters and  there will hardly people will be seen around the premises of cinema theaters
1678,1675,rajesh kumar,komal ji and raj one thing i want to make clear as a big fan of indian cinema earlier days i used to watch movies in only theaters but as time passed by the interest of going to theater is going down due to the ticket rates and on top of it the charges that are being charged for snack and parking fee are more than the movie ticket now a days so until unless these things are given at lower rates like parking fee not more than rs and snacks at their original rates people will not come to theaters in my opinion definitely these are things that always a common man thinks about going to theater and most of them stopped going also 
1679,1676,D V L 🌟 GAMER 99,ott big money pay movies but cinemas price increase any time

1681,1678,Mayur Shingade,ott is definitely a matter of convineance having said that the cinematic experience can never be provided by a mobile phone screen actually this will make the makers of cinema put more effort in their work and bring out a larger than life effect in their movies the viewer understands which content he has to watch on the big screen and which to watch on a tablet scree a movie like tanhaji or bajirao mastani or uri can be viewed and enjoyed only and only on the big screen

2224,2219,Joetta Gonzalez,i love going to the theater the one reason that i have gone less often over the past  years is the cost it is simply too expensive especially when i can watch the movie at home with as many people as i want for around  with popcorn and a soda for everyone if i go to the theater im going to spend around  bucks per person its unreasonable and i simply cant justify that expenditure unless its something i feel should absolutely be seen on the big screen that said i havent been to the theater since  thats over  years and says a lot
2225,2220,Tomas,absolutely be seen on the big screen like  lord of the rings  they are great on tv too
2226,2221,elnick1000,i am going to a movie theater today to see the batman first the good news theaters today are a lot cleaner than they were in the early s or before also  perhaps as not many missing pieces to a film though that happened when i went to see running man in the late s and the theater manager lady knew nothing about this  th i am going to be  years old this month when i go see this movie it will be  hours and  minutes no intermission i am  percent sure but back in the s theyre would have been an intermission the theater is losing out now because i probably wont want to buy a drink also the previews just go on way too long i also have a very large tv screen now where i can enjoy the movie just as well as in the theater and i feel i get more out of watching the movie that way
2227,2222,Holiday197,chances are that of a movie is bad youll want to stay because you want to experience the movie with everyone paraphrased nope if i dont like the movie or cant get into it ill leave especially if there is quite a bit more to gobrbrcase in point as a kid i was bored watching one of the lord of the rings movies first one i believe and i convinced my parents to leave with me while there was a packed theatre
2228,2223,Alex AKA A. Charles Ross,the more people in the theater the more anxious i feel because its more opportunity for people to be rude being alone in the theater is like heaven on earth for me now that i have a projector at home i dont know if i want to continue going to the theater
2229,2224,Formakiwi,one factor left out of the analysis of why a lot of people longer attend movie theatres is other people specifically the frequently appalling antisocial and entitled behaviour of many moviegoers phones beeping and buzzing people scrolling or conducting conversations via message apps talking intimidating others who object basically showing zero respect or consideration to other attendees is a big reason why i rarely go to the cinema anymore and i know im not the only one this is what happens when you neglect to teach more than one generation in a row any sense of manners or consideration and convince them that their own feelings and personal ego gratification are the only valid concerns they should ever have
2230,2225,Tomas,movie theaters need to invest in camera technology and screen development redefinition of cinema screen  so that the screen is empowered to deliver quotmore content more artistic power and hence more viewer impactquot per square inch than a tv or phone ever can deliver
2231,2226,Joetta Gonzalez,movie theaters need to invest in the experience in general pay workers decent wages so theyll care about their jobs put money back into the personal experience
2232,2227,Tomas, gonzalez   if the theatres want to pull in audience dramatically into their theaters they have to offer far better and unique ware that what is on offer now this seems to me to be possible only if there has been an acute possibly radical  improvement in films especially when seen on the big theater screens  the power to radically improve films however rests with the film makers and what exactly this might be ive posted above
2233,2228,Eros Sinema,oh please an industry that wants to charge  to see some lousy flick and has the audacity to force people to watch  min of commercials before they actually present what you paid for actually wonders why people dont like movie theatres the complaints dont stop there he knows what the list of complaints are why go through that when you can watch it on your enotepad computer or on the comfort of your couch with a big screen tv
2234,2229,Ashish Yadav,movies should be made which make the audience cry laugh and for the  hours people are in sync with the filmsthen theatre will be flooded with people
2235,2230,Yanti Mohhan,some of the movies i didnt get it  but my son always explained to me so i got more knowledge about whats going on its educated me
2236,2231,I.K,covid was the final nail in the coffin for movie theaters
2237,2232,okcomputer0101,my local mom and pop theater closed im thinking of buying it during covid feels super risky
2238,2233,SirchOne,how wrong you were
2239,2234,Dayyan Ahmad,i dont think so
2240,2235,Madison Hang,i watch so many free movies on youtube its funny
2241,2236,Madison Hang,you must be the tech guy cuz damnbrthe audio on this one suckks
2242,2237,concretespecial,another pointmultiplexes have literally destroyed the movie going experience   id love to see them all burn to the ground   support your local theaters
2243,2238,concretespecial,hmmmintellectual discussion over moronic superhero films  when hollywood starts showing films again worth discussing wequotll talk   until then ill stick with foreign cinema made for those with more than  iq points
2244,2239,I WANT MY SLAW!!,i have been to the movies hundreds of times throughout my life and over the years ive gotten less and less enchanted with the experience i loved going to momandpop movie theaters but the mcmovie theater aka the multiplex and hollywoods lack of creativity have completely ruined that wonderful experience the movies have gotten worse the popcorn is gotten worse the staff has gotten worse the audience has gotten worse and the overall experience has gotten worse almost to the point where i feel they dont care anymore and if they dont care anymore i dont care to go they no longer take pride in what it is they do anymorebrbri remember when i was a kid there was this theater run by the older couple they were absolutely wonderful i would go every single week i would never miss a week sometimes i would even go two or three times a week just for the experience and to support them as they had become my friends before every movie would start the husband would come into the theater and tell you what the movie was about they would also tell you what movies were coming up in the upcoming weeks they would tell you about their promotions that they were having such as  tuesdays and he would even make a joke saying quotif you dont like th he movie you can come in and sleep  for a good nap is a pretty good dealquot and they took so much pride in their popcorn which was delicious way better than any popcorn ive ever had at a mcmovie theater and then after the the movie you can go outside of the theater and chat with them and have a wonderful discussion about the movie with them thats what is missing today the people who are running the cinema dont care about cinema anymore its a bunch of snotnosed teens who dont know anything and simply dont care they just see this as a job this is not a passion for them thats whats missing today is the passion the passion that the momandpop theaters had you dont get that with the mcmovie theaters
2245,2240,Lost Cause,all of the mctheaters where i live pay  an hour so yes the staff has stopped caring
2246,2241,Vikas Tiwari,thanks for sharing your exp you are right the passion which is what getting missing in things and thingsmovie becoming more and  more a tool for making profit from so called movie business
2247,2242,I WANT MY SLAW!!, tiwari im glad you agree because people will scapegoat the pandemic as what ruined theaters but i feel theaters were ruined long before that theres no love that is being put in the theater just like what made grandmas cooking so great and now that grandmas gone the foods just not the same
2248,2243,AdeloyeArts,at minimum wage the economy and  population dont expect people to see a job as more than a job i get it its less social but thats a consequence of the decision makers  more so than the teenagers
2249,2244,I WANT MY SLAW!!, yes thats a byproduct of the mcmovie theater there was a time before walmart where mom and pop stores would be all over the place and they were just wonderful they were quaint and unique the owners were also the people running the store the were warm and friendly they knew your name and they were extremely knowledgeable about their goods and services those days are gone
2250,2245,AdeloyeArts, want my slaw yeah i agree that things are not as personal as they used to but this isnt the fault of the teenager trying to get a job maybe im being too fixated on that detail but i feel the need to emphasise that the people that push  the lack of intimacy are the guys who want to make another billion on the billions they make and not the guy trying to add  per hour
2251,2246,Joey Baseball,maybe hollywood should make better movies instead of just making sequels and reboots
2252,2247,dan,they do but people like you dont watch those films
2253,2248,Aml 2020,wrong lol
2254,2249,Lorenz Müller,well see
2255,2250,Lorenz Müller,movie fans do not care
2256,2251,Liberty Manuel,i love going to the movies and i always will
2257,2252,Jamie McPhee,i agree
2258,2253,Pradeepkumar Dakua,g
2259,2254,ProjectCreativityGuy96,movies have lost spark completely now but the technology and hd quality has gotten beyond our expectations thoughbrbrcome on what ever happened to real effort movies if that still existed hollywood would save cinema houses from going bankrupt and have the film industry running normal as possiblebrbrthe fans have just got to be faithful and be a regular at their local cinema to help support the movie industry
2260,2255,Spencer Evans,what this guy just talked about is precisely why i prefer to watch upcoming movies for the first time in theaters then on an iphone it is always a good experience for me and trust me ive seen plenty of movies for the first time in theaters
2261,2256,Coarsick Media,and now you probably never will again
2262,2257,p!erre,online streaming has taken over so it is ott
2263,2258,La Dolce Vita,because hollywood has  ideas
2264,2259,JOHNNYFILMS, dolce vita its not that they dont have ideas every movie out there was an idea yet to be thought of hollywood is scared of ideas because they dont promise money i think with streaming services theyve realized they need to keep coming up with ideas to put on there so we keep getting original stories now
2265,2260,JO Delevante, dolce vita hollywood has no ideas ha like thats ever going to happen
2266,2261,Raesling Undomiel,tbh i thought this was going to be about the larger cineplexes and how theaters are becoming more themed and experiential
2267,2262,kombucha.,i feel like were all communicating more esp with the internettheyre are definitely real discussions and conversations being had
2268,2263,Alan Morris,ive always known movie theaters were on their way out i live in a small city and we used to have three drivein theaters and four movie theaters all of them are gone now a few years ago they opened a large cinemark tinseltown theater with multiple theaters inside it used to have a huge marquee with light up letters you could see from the street but they recently took it down because they couldnt afford the amount of electricity it pulled
2269,2264,Mysteriouso100,i miss the marquees showing whats playing it was actually pretty helpful and spurred interest in seeing something spur of the moment quothey look theyve got suchandsuch movie playing at a href lets goquot
2270,2265,Occasional Dose of Ordinary,i never comment on youtube but im going to on this one this guy has no clue people stay home and watch movies based on human conveniences i can eat all the popcorn i want soda food for almost nothing i can pause a movie and go to the bathroom i like movies in a movie theaterbut almost never go unless its a totally anticipated movie give mea  min pause in a movie for a toilet break refill my drink its totally a human convenience thing the whole i get a better experience with other people may be right for some but others may prefer the quiet of the living room cellphones loud obnoxious teens kids balling this sort of thing stops me from getting all the little details in a movie i understand the guys point herebut his point only covers half the population just depends on what is most important
2271,2266,La Dolce Vita,being in a movie theater is an experience period
2272,2267,Occasional Dose of Ordinary, addhya first i dont watch on an iphone a surround sound k experience is always superior quality as for claiming laziness some work long hours and find it way more comfortable to not have to mess with overpriced concessions in a theater and wait times you assume things about me that you have no idea about i acknowledge ones want for a social component in the theater but superiorlolhardly and youre right it is an experience an over priced usually loud obnoxious bad one ill stay at home and watch as the theater industry implodes from lack of profit from us smart movie watchers lol
2273,2268,Alex AKA A. Charles Ross,i think any movie that is longer than  hours should have an intermission half way through a lot of older movies use to do that so people could go pee or get more snacks
2274,2269,Dayyan Ahmad, aka a charles ross in india we always have interval breven if its hollywood movie they stop movie after fist half for minimum  minutes
2275,2270,Jeremy,i used to love going to movie theaters now i hate it because of loud audience members people on cellphones and the ongoing  fear of someone entering the theater and shooting me to death i love watching films on netflix and disney plus its fantastic because for  dollars a month i can enjoy thousands of hours of entertainment at home going to the theater is expensive  bucks a piece to see one film that may or may not be good is too much to spend when youre living paycheck to paycheck with streaming services everyone can watch the film and have a wonderful time  and if it isnt a good film its no big deal plus i love the original films that netflix and disney plus are producing movie theaters for me are dead and i will not miss them for one second
2276,2271,Manoj Mallick,watching in ott and watching in theaters its totally different its the experience we enjoy  every houses has kitchen still lots of people go outside for food 
2277,2272,Luke Hayes,this should be trending
2278,2273,Don Mooney,then shouldnt movie critics watch and review movies with live public audiences then  brinstead of watching it privately or alone  brbri bet the reviewers would never value the art enough to give away that little touch of elitist early access lolbrbrmaybe the movie creators should change with the times  to create movies with the intent of how they will be viewed of they are still creating them  with the theater large number of viewers in mindbrbrcould jordan peele possibly of had some sort of points on his movie   that he got more money based on the number of the viewers it got at the theaters  instead of streaming or else wherebrbrthat could possibly also made an impact   on why he made the statement about his movie being intended to be seen in a large group theater setting  lol  just curious
2279,2274,LARY GIBBIONS,the demise of theaters will be the same as shopping malls
2280,2275,Mysteriouso100,i personally doubt it the experience of groups of people going into the dark and being told a story is ancient its as old as mankind were hardwired for storytelling and community
2281,2276,Tim Stroud,so maybe theaters need to make an quotexperiencequot out of movies rather than just show up and sell tickets
2282,2277,CharlieBrown,ipic gives you a whole expirence
2283,2278,Mrship ofSteam,thank you sir for this inspiring presentation
2284,2279,Rafael Santos,really appreciated this talk thanks for helping me think about this
2285,2280,Tidepool Clipper,it is essentially the fault of both the movie theaters and hollywood themselvesbrbrthe theaters for overcharging the tickets trying to justify artificially inflating the ticket prices with the failed d gimmick and cutting corners with the customer servicebrbrhollywood for their lack of originality almost every movie these days is a remakerebootsoftrebootretellingsequelprequelmidqueladaption speaking of adaptions they love to make horrible adaptions of video games and anime the increasing commonality of bad movies at a theater per year thus are scaring people away from the theaters as people are worried they will end up watching a bad movie infamous actors and directors who are now in a bad spotlight and yet still end up earning too much money deceptive advertising while the first amazing spiderman is still better than its sequel they advertised multiple scenes that were altered or didnt even appear in the final product movies trying to become more political and directors pandering to china which happened with one of the michael bay transformers movies
2286,2281,Alan Jackson,completely agree your points the movie business is a key player as to why movie theaters are facing difficult times as i dont feel they are properly reading the tea leaves on how audiences tastes have evolved  while sequels and remakes can be good if done right the focus on those films while seeming to ignore many smaller original films is causing people to look for other entertainment options  i just hope the movie theaters can understand this and change their model to better highlight those smaller and more unique films that should be enjoyed in a group setting  it requires them spending more energy on the theater experience rather than just focusing on how many big budget films they can squeeze into the multiplex  thanks for your thoughts and feedback
2287,2282,John Morgan,most films that come out today are original films people just dont go see them also its not quotdeceptive marketingquot you do know that films arent completed before the trailers start coming out right they have to put out something to get the audiences aware and excited but the cut of the film almost always changes after the first or second trailer and some shots in the trailer wont actually be in the final cut thats because the film is still in post production until its release but they cant wait until the week before the film to release the first trailer
2288,2283,Lost Cause,movies dont make money on tickets thats hollywoods fault for using quarter billion dollars worth of cameras for no reason
2289,2284,Vox,thanks for watching let us know in the comments below if you think the movie theater experience is still something that cant be replicated and what movie youre looking forward to watching in theaters next

2293,2288,mig189189189,movie theaters are the best way to watch movies if you are looking for a new concept of watching movies you can always use both home cinema and movie theaters
2294,2289,TheBakmoi,watching dune in imax is a different experience unless you got a cinema a at home my rule of thumb is go to cinema only if the movie is expected to be good and h
2295,2290,mig189189189, youre right about that my dear fellow thanks for sharing with us your comment 
2296,2291,Madison, thats a good rule i rarely stream but i do have netflix i even still borrow movies from the library 
2297,2292,Bob dabiuld,the metaverse will bring around a decline in theaters within a decade or two but an extinction is unlikely

2302,2297,John,dont care to go to theatres any more pandemic was just a tipping point for years before i had taken advantage of the fact that i was already working from home to see movies at like am on a tuesday so there were like  elderly couples and one other family maybe even then id reserve that for spectacle films but honestly im pretty happy with my quot tv and  dts system and have big comfy chairs and a sofa with a smaller quot   dts surround not a sound bar in sight in my room should i desire to watch in bed which usually ends up in needing like  nights to finish a movie because i nod off brbrnot to mention pause and my own private bathroombrbrshort of the bathroom i can think of one time when things were so nice i was the last person in town to see the first batman keaton  hundred  something so a friend took me and we were the only two people in the theatre it was  min after it was supposed to start and we were getting impatient so i yelled out quotyou might as well start it nowquot and the lights went down and it startedbrbrof course im an introvert and really dont like being packed in with other people so theres that

2305,2300,Killerbean, man you really need to get out there as an introvert myself  movie theaters are the best place to visit in the whole world i am being childish butbri mean you dont have to talk to anyone everyones silent and then there is the whole experience of blending in with with the environment of the movie i dont know where you live but going once a while to the cinema can be a great mood up for yourself

2308,2303,Crow Craven,cinematic experience still the bestand waiting for spiderman
2309,2304,jabbany,the more people prefer the value of cinematic experience the stronger the argument is to get rid of a quottheatrical windowquot clearly plenty of people are willing to go to a theater without being forced to do so with an exclusivity period
2310,2305,L16htW4rr10r,i love movie theater i will never stop watching in movie theater

2318,2313,•,spider man
2319,2314,R S2002,poor job voxbrbrwhybrbr you miss the fact that universal have agreed to extend big title movie windows from  days to  days if they demonstrate strong box office takings this was evident for movies like f which was extended to keep up the demandbrbr throughout the theatrical window it is established that virtually all movies make  of their total box office in the first  days thus reducing the window to  days isnt a problem it in fact helps the situation by allowing more regular movie going and its no secret that more movies are released from so many more studios the entire filming and release process has got a lot fasterbrbrstreaming is a tv experience which also differs significantly from the big screen theatrical one cinema is an art form in its own right and isnt going anywhere brbrspider man no way home has demonstrated this very recentlybrbrchina has also recovered  of its box office to prepandemic levels and i expect we will see western territories do the same early 
2320,2315,The Horror,please give the animator a bells absolutely neat editing
2321,2316,Ines Axus,definitely felt that when watching dont look up on netflix the day of its release felt weird to know wed never get to see it on a big screen with full volume i really love the idea that we can enjoy films in many different ways cause we all have our moods amp schedules but theaters are so important when you want to have a strong experience with a film loved the video vox
2322,2317,Lilith Aram,i used to enjoy going to movies as a teen but prices have gotten outrageous it cost  for a family of  to go to a movie more if its d i would rather just stay at home buy bulk sour patch kids make my familys own popcorn and watch on tv rather than go through the expensive hassle

2326,2321,Twinny,i rather wait  months for a movie instead of watching it in a theater
2327,2322,Jayson Caliso,watching movies on theatre is exciting experience rather than waiting for release on other formats
2328,2323,Jack Ehaus,i worked at amc while this was happening and movies seemed like they were barely around for more than a day
2329,2324,Benjamin Young,went and saw sonic  at my local largest cineplex and the projector quality was miserable it was so dark even for such a bright movie any scrolling or panning of the image would completely chop up the image into a blur and take about a  a second to stabilize when still the fur effects on sonic were like tv static most of the movie
2330,2325,Luís,because people know they can take off their masks
2331,2326,D G,there may be truth to this but when i go to the theaters they always seemed empty when i saw a film even before covid
2332,2327,Axel Halbardier,i love how a little thing become a conflict even in vox
2333,2328,XsXx,they make shity movies anyway
2334,2329,StaticBlaster,movie theaters will never be dead because even if you could make a movie theater experience at your own home you still lose the social aspect of it its cool to experience what people are feeling and hearing the laughter around you its a very human thing to feel like you are connecting with everyone around you
2335,2330,Karina Salmeron,c that explains everything no wonder why the movie theater look so emptybrdid is so sad
2336,2331,Tracy Clements,the reason why movie theaters arent dead yet is because of the success of the marvel cinematic universe theres always an anticipated super heroe movie thanks to them
2337,2332,Nova,who tf was stuck at home during the pandemic and was like yeah lemme put on the new trolls movie
2338,2333,RemnantSeapunk,the best thing about going to the movies is not knowing anything about a movie and just buying a ticket based on the poster alone thats something i see happening less with the new movie going climate after the height of the pandemic of

2341,2336,:Ownworld,i would love to see a  movie theater and maybe one day a  movie theater where the movie its self is not confined to a massive tv a  one would make it more like a vr experience without the headset
2342,2337,Antonio Silva,movies on theaters are essential in lot of levels even if i dont know why
2343,2338,Warrington Feaslefeet,quotin the usquotbrbrok that just made this video irrelevant to me
2344,2339,Nigel He,i think ill wait for streaming than pay exorbitant prices to a theater
2345,2340,ultraali453,im more interested in being absorbed in the movie i have never been to cinema i would imagine that it is less immersive because i can hear other people in the room instead at home i am at my desk in a dark room and im wearing headphones i cant see how a theater will be more immersive
2346,2341,Gumbo,movies as you know it will cease to exist after movie theatres
2347,2342,Buck Strickland,rather wait til it comes out then spend  plus at the theater
2348,2343,Darius Sykes,i think this has a lot to do with digital piracy  as well the movie studios lost tons of money from everything being streamed from home as well
2349,2344,Jacob Everson,i can bring back cinema br im a film directorbr the greatest to ever live

2353,2348,Disney Movies Blog TV Channel,the movie theatrical exclusivity release window was shorten even before the covid pandemic for example disneypixar toy story  released to movie theaters in the united states of america on june friday   you only had to wait for four months for the st pixar animated feature film to be released on digital on october tuesday   and then on dvd bluray and k ultra hd bluray one week later on october tuesday  
2354,2349,Denys Almaral,what i see here is the consumer interest and convenience has been always out of the equation
2355,2350,Macbasil,movie theaters will never be debunked there is something exciting feeling to go on a cinema date alone or with friends something that you cannot get at home you get to be with people who love the movie and can create friendships inside the cinema hearing all the people laugh together its the place that sources peace and harmony plus the huge screen and digital surround sound by dolby it will thrive
2356,2351,Ray Slavenburg,i just bought two tickets to go see uncharted two weeks from now just so i can see it in imax the movie hasnt released here yet but an adventure movie just has to be seen on the big screen

2361,2356,Tyler Douglas,can anyone tell me is it safe to watch a movie like does mask actually help while sitting for nearly hrs or  hrs like if wear my mask the whole time cause im trying to watch a the batman
2362,2357,Gabriel Litewski,i feel very sorry i went overboard being addicted to movies
2363,2358,Ted,going to the theater is like going to a restaurant its about the experience not the actual product even if the product itself is identical or can be closely replicated eg going to dennys to get bacon and eggs which is easy to make at home the communal act of sharing the experience with someone in public is basic to human nature you can end the theatrical window and there will always be a market albeit smaller for watching movies on the big screen brbrlike restaurants movie theaters can never be sufficiently duplicated to disappear  renting videos from stores or shopping for products at brick and mortar however is more vulnerable
2364,2359,Just Thomas Russell, well actually your wrong they became hotels
2365,2360,Ximolia,everyone has a kitchen yet we all enjoy going to restaurant every so often movies an theaters are just the same when you think about it
2366,2361,Dylan,there have been countless movies that have been ruined by other patrons who bring their disruptive its all about me personality into the theater theaters have an obligation to ensure compliance with rules so everyone has a positive experience i will not return to a theater until there is accountability by way of an usher stationed in each theater enforcing no talking or cell phone usage during the film the days are over with spending  on a movie and snacks only to have some shmuck ruin the experience by talking back at the movie screen

2383,2378,David,maybe it also has something to do with distractions watching at the theater you dont have the usual distractions nobody talks or is on the phone unless they are rude so everybody gets a focused experience
2384,2379,The Devil,nah its different to watch a movie in your  inches phone or the huge screen with people sharing the experience with you come on its more fun maybe if it was cheaper we would go more often

2389,2384,dr rd,yeah i remember waiting  years to get all  movies on dvd one movie came out once a year then you wait about a year for the dvd release so by the time you got all  movies in a box set it was after about  years since the first movie was released yeah you enjoyed movies so much more because you have to wait so long before you can buy the dvd

2402,2397,Sergio Cabrera,i think that going to the cinema is a unique and very different experience compared to watching a movie at home even if you have or do not have a super k screen with home theater  this being the case i think that the current way of projecting movies should change because the image quality that you can get on your television is very noticeable even when your television is full hd compared to a cinema this in terms of contrast and loss of color   thankfully this is changing with samsung onyx cinemas  they totally change the viewing experience of going to a cinema  these cinemas are like a giant television not projection with the miniled technology that they are incorporating into their new televisions

2424,2419,"Ha ha, He he, Ho ho",i love watching horror movies in theater its scarier because of the dark hall and is kinda funny when everyone gets startled by something like a jump scare
2425,2420,Samuel Barber,i think movie theatres are still around because the experience one can offer especially when youre watching a new marvel or star wars movie its kind of like what happened back in the day when television became more widespread and movie theatres tried to compete by making new large scale epic films in vibrant colour however what happened after that was when movie studios tried to be too bold with films like cleopatra the system kind of collapsed and essentially started the new hollywood era personally im a champion of movie theatres going to see a movie in the theatre is just incomparable its why im really psyched to see the godfather rerelease in theatres even though i have that film on streaming and dvd and im not even a massive fan of that film i prefer the godfather part ii youre not just seeing the movie youre getting out of your quiet little box and sharing an experience with a room of strangers
2426,2421,Natalie Andrew,when a group of people are all excited to see the same movie and theres a real rule and understanding of not talking but gasps and laughs and stuff are so fun when theyre together theres such an incredible ambiance

2436,2431,Kaitlyn D,watched halloween kills in the theatre a while back and it reminded me why movie theatres are so magical the people behind me were laughing at the same things my friends and i were and when one of my friends was getting frustrated with one of the characters actions the people beside us were noticing and thought it was funny it brings people together in a weird way and i hope they continue to be profitable and exist because id miss them
2437,2432,Alastor Lestrange,my sister was playing dune on tv and when i came home and saw that i just said look how they massacred my boy
2438,2433,Kate Butler,movie theater is still the best way to go for movies youre really excited about like the latest ghostbusters movie theres no way you can get that movie theater experience and atmosphere at home being with other people who love the movies enough to come together and share in an emotional and nostalgic movie experience its the best feeling theres nothing like it plus that movie theater popcorn is the best  but obviously not every movie is worthy of going to a theater for and thats okay too

2441,2436,Jocy Ram,the can move to vr 
2442,2437,Mad Cat Sphere,movies are dead because there is no new philosophy or idea to explore the hasnt been done before and done better in the past movies keep going because of money very unhealthy for society and hollywood writers can say that they can come up with new ideas but can those ideas create new frashise or even something that can stand the test of time similar to star wars star trek or averagers i dont think so not to mention those ideas and plots in them are already old
2443,2438,Shirley Timple,the last film i watched in a theater was star wars episode  theaters serve no purpose in my life
2444,2439,Jakob Hellyer,i watched scream in at theatre with  other people and it was still great going to the theatres makes movies so much more special

2451,2446,Kenneth Tomlin,there is always someone coughing annoyingly in a movie theatre no thanks
2452,2447,Lil BrainZ,well amc is a company that i am extremely proud to be a part owner in and not only is there a bright future for cinema but new technologies will change the type of experiences that cinemas can offerbrand now that netflix has become a more successful film studio than universal but netflix is also losing its subscribers to the studios new streaming services they have one choice to focus on producing films and selling them to either the other streaming services or to the cinemas and i doubt they would support other streaming services
2453,2448,Llama Del Fid,i actually have never been to one im  not really a quotomg im excited to watch this movie nowquot kinda person so i just wait for it to air on my screen
2454,2449,Lou Bold,i thought disney had a few same day vod and theatrical releases a major chain of theaters in europe refused to show jungle cruise and black widow for that reason
2455,2450,Maarten683,dead to all movie theaters
2456,2451,Searchingforcrosser,i can think of a simple solution movie theatres will play the movies of the studios but their negotiations and airing contracts would have a little change studios would only be allowed to distribute the movies in their houses if they agree to give them a  cut of their total profits from vod free to air cable or streaming services airings before during and after it was aired on their respective movie houses pretty neat huh it is the same scheme with car financingbrbrof course you would say quotthen the studios would just abandon these movie houses altogether and switch to digital streamingquot to which i say movie houses should form a formidable force at congress so that they pass a law to force this arrangement on the different cinema studiosbrbreverybody wins right
2457,2452,Abelina Portillo,watching a movie in a theater is a great but having the flexibility to enjoy from anywhere is also great in my modest opinion im for these changes actors are overpaid and filming is overly expensive time to level the fields
2458,2453,Maximiliano Zuñixtli,theaters need to change the structure of it themselves and modernize if they wanna save it besides watching a movie with a friend i wanna have something else different
2459,2454,Ben Arnold,i watched dune in imax cinema definitely aint dead
2460,2455,Carlos Martinez,unless you have a moderate home theater with surround sound and a kicking subwoofer nothing beats a state of the art theater like imax plus the experience of going out of the house
2461,2456,Michael Jordan,as an introvert i prefer watching movies at home im glad many movies are skipping the theaters altogether
2462,2457,Vitto,if you appreciate good quality image and extreme sound quality it is impossible to avoid theaters and the experience too with some movie i remember the seat that i get and what i did after the movie
2463,2458,lone wolf,the vibe of a movie theater is different from the vibe within your living room while watching a movie going out with your friends for a movie is a different type of fun
2464,2459,Oh Kay,ill tell you what if they stop using movie theaters were gonna start charging people to watch movies at my house
2465,2460,mlong9475,let just cut to the chase people go to movie theaters to watch movies on a bigger screen than they have at home and certain genres benefit being on the big screen like scifi movies and blockbuster movies romantic comedies and other that lack special effect dont need big screen at all because the visual effect is just not there
2466,2461,Eisset Juanich,watching a horror movie at the theater is soooo intense and so much better than watching it at home the screams and intensity of the audience is something u cant replicate at home
2467,2462,Rahul77,watched no way home in theatre after a month later it was released and there were like  people in the theatre brreally good experience with d though
2468,2463,Xander Ramírez,the number one movie in america  commercials about a movie that isnt even out yet
2469,2464,Ulysses Morando,because latinos disproportionately still believe in going to the movies  youre welcome
2470,2465,Dalton Brennan,anyone operating a theater and anyone sending movies to theaters should be treated like pastors who have churches open they should all be tried for attempted murder on multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple multiple counts
2471,2466,Minori Aung,i think the experience is the biggest thing keeping the cinema industry alive being able to do something nice and relative cheap even though you can watch something at home to be able to see the movie to its fullest experience that most working class cant get at home is really unique
2472,2467,Selman Jaouhara,theatres need stay and i hope never go the experience is different both picture and sound quality cant be matched and not to mention the social aspect where you go and watch a family be ecstatic to see a movie over hear what others thought of the movie in real time rather than someone going home and editing everything say etc
2473,2468,William Oscar Garvin,i do feel that driving theaters are gonna really replace amc theaters which does seem though that it is a better movie experience that you can do whatever you want more than you can do at amc theaters although although the one advantage amc theaters that the driving theater does not have is everything with diner and its beauty and glory that you can want although driving theaters have cars and everything that makes it more fun than what you can do at amc theaters and ill admit that and now that i think about it i would go to driving theaters

2484,2479,Tevin Simelane,classic vox video informative and short 
2485,2480,gzuzumaki2,that shrinking theatrical window prepandemic has prevented me from seeing movies i wanted to see in theaters nowadays if theres a movie i havent seen yet and its already out of theaters i dont buy into the streaming services or vods these studios want me to buy i have my other ways
2486,2481,Avourrito,because its the big screen and awesome speakers thats why
2487,2482,supriyo chakraborty,i think movie theatres wont be obsolete in near future because people of our generation millennials still feel the need to be connected with each other sure theatres might need restructuring to include other activities but they will be there
2488,2483,chakrapolis,i dont really watch a lot of movies or tv but i would much rather go to a movie theatre than rent a movie its fun

2493,2488,Youssef Sa3i,the video is mute
2494,2489,Infiniti VII,amc
2495,2490,Chris Felonall,there are many reasons why theater is still a thing brbr having shared reactions within the viewers the laughs the applause the cries the hype they tend to make people feel happy and get people get goosebumps from those experiencesbrbr everyone wants to be updated almost everyone wants to be on trend those windows those are also the days everyone on social media twitter facebook instagram reddit forums post and share their experiences discussion and even memes about the movie everyone wants to ride the hype train and stay up to the trendbrbr bspoilersb because of no  its not easy for people these times to avoid those spoilers now that some people cant resist posting their individual experiences during those movies especially when they got hyped up or excited some people just want to let their feelings theyve experienced from the movie out to discuss thembrbr theater is a huge cash grab for the movie producers look at those rankings of box office they make billions of dollars from opening and those windows alone its like the theater are for short term high risk high rewardthey just have to run the publicityads better for more profit and its a burst of money in one go  studios the electronics on the other hand is for the long term little money is being made compared to the theatre profit but more of a stable long term profit
2496,2491,PhilYi,they will never be dead  even the stage theater is not dead
2497,2492,Ela Owczarczyk,why isnt movie theaters deadbrme who went to the movie theater a few times the past  months i wonder why

2500,2495,Shubham Mitra,why do you want it to be dead
2501,2496,Natalie,i watch lots of movies at home but going to the cinema is more like a trip i might see a movie that i normally would never watch just to go to the cinema
2502,2497,Adrian Mei, few people have the quality sound system at homebr few people have such a huge screen at homebr you can pause the movie or be distracted by something at homebr going to the movies is a social activity on top of viewing the movie often you go out for a meal before or after with friends and family etcbr the atmospheres are completely different
2503,2498,Ray ᛋ Deathray,i just love how the movie that will be etched into history as being pivotal is trolls world tour
2504,2499,byrnesy919,im all for theatres existing since it provides jobs and a greater viewing experience but i dont agree with the long exclusive windows for theatres only i think it should be streamable same day think of the amount money the studios are missing out on not everyone has access right now to a movie theatre with covid restrictions and vaccine requirements nearly every home as some sort of media streaming device in the home id much rather spend  to watch it in the comfort of my home
2505,2500,Petter,some movies are cinema movies like marvel james bond and other epics

2511,2506,Matthew Chang,wow
2512,2507,Roni Jr,you go to the theater for the experience not necessarily for the movie  you cant really replicate a movie experience in a living room im pretty sure im not the only one because look at halloween kills spiderman no way home for example
2513,2508,J,i dont think things like pandemic steaming and shortened theatrical windows can stop theaters hollywood dumping burning garbage onto our screens is a different story though
2514,2509,CornishCreamtea07,some movies are just made to be seen in cinema especially those mm films that tarantino and nolan make i really liked watching french dispatch and the last duel in cinema they really benefited from the bug screen treatment its also still a great place for little children to watch the latest pixar and marvel movie
2515,2510,ScreamingTrees 96,yea no i dont care for netflix or any of that i enjoy the experience of going to the theatre from the smell to watching an anticipated movie on the big screen it gives you an experience you cant really get at home brbrim sure a lot of other people feel the same way
2516,2511,Video Games Incorporated,except that quotno theatrical dayanddate in quot thing already isnt holding water universal is releasing a dayanddate movie in february

2522,2517,Maria Tereza,theaters have become part of human culture now and it will probably last for more decades even if not in the tradional way we know of
2523,2518,SirAlpha,i dont get why most of the people enjoy going to a theater for it is bothersome and not a great experience because all of the noise from the other guest i also find the experience to expensive for what i get if watch many movies i would probably buy a  inch tv  soundsystem instead of watching movies at a theater again
2524,2519,CynLagos,i was wondering what happened here i felt that shift now theaters just need to focus on their hospitality
2525,2520,Andy Summers THX Cinema and my Cats,i hope cinemas and pinewood and hollywood all the technical people end up with no job and the film and cinema indusytry goes bankrupt i fucjing couldnt care less about dolby labs garbage human trash dolby atmos or barco auro garbage trash or dtsx garbage trash or imax garbage trash or liemax garbage trash or thx human garbage trash anymore or star wars garbage trash or marvel garbage trash or dc comic garbage trash

2527,2522,Loui S.,i grew up with movie theaters theres no way im gonna stop going to theaters for the rest of my life just because i have the opportunity it to watch it on my couch i use hulu disney  for older movies only
2528,2523,Lilith Aram,i used to enjoy going to movies as a teen but prices have gotten outrageous it cost  for a family of  to go to a movie more if its d i would rather just stay at home buy bulk sour patch kids make my familys own popcorn and watch on tv rather than go through the expensive hassle that being said there are certain movies that i do want to see in the theater so i guess i see both sides of it
2529,2524,AAron.,anyone going to the theater is going for the experience not to just see the movie
2530,2525,Bowen Fulwood-Griffiths,no no because d will boom

2535,2530,bugboy,i hope movie theatres go on for as long as possible its honestly just way better and more fun to watch a movie in a theatre than at home on a computer

2537,2532,Ortho☦️doge,i watched dune in the theatre and then at home on hbo yeah the theatre is way better
2538,2533,Prakash Baskar,nothing can match theatre experience for some movies  may be family drama  comedies can be watched in tv or mobile but for  horror science fiction we have that experience  only in theatre   i still remember the movie quotgravityquot what a experience
2539,2534,SiejeDesign,i like to pause a movie so i can use the loo also i dont like overtly loud sounds so watching at home allows me the control of them decibels

2543,2538,Jonathan Odude,you cannot replicate a sense of oneness with others at home shared experiences are real and movie theatres are the most common of them
2544,2539,fabian van eijk,personally i like to go to the cinema to watch a movie when watching a movie at home i get distracted faster and miss parts of the movie but in the cinema im fully focused on the movie and experience more of the movie just like school from home i learn more in the classroom than when im behind the computer listening to a zoom meeting allday

2550,2545,Fernando Anacleto Firmino,thats kind of an awesome episode
2551,2546,Ben Altair,im surprised piracy wasnt mentioned once one of the big powers of theatres is restricting viewership to paid ticket holders before its released in a rippable format

2553,2548,Kevin O,will always support local theatres having been born long after the original star wars films were released i never had the chance to experience those films on the big screen but due to to the shortage of films being released i got a chance to watch them last year in a theatre and it was  times better than anything at home

2560,2555,TheDaybid,just watching movies with a many likeminded crowd with laughing cheering and crying in memorable scenes in these theaters can never be replaced
2561,2556,RD Castillo's Youtube Diary,seeing a movie in theaters is still different from being at home just like how theaters cannot replace stage plays too much and will still survive no matter what
2562,2557,Omaris Powell,i believe if movie theaters stay around its only going to stay because its a experience deeply rooted in american culture with so many first dates family outings and movies and shows always having people going to the movies people will only go solely for the culture and not because its the best option like daylight savings for example we dont need it anymore but we do it because its a tradition thats deeply rooted in american culture as well as other cultures around the world

2570,2565,David Mulder,its interesting my and my wife definitely prefer watching at home but my wife hates waiting for a movie so the theatrical window is literally the only reason some of the money goes to the cinema rather than all of it going to the movie studios
2571,2566,Cartier231,i disagree sometimes you want to go to the mall or somewhere else to watch movies you dont always have too or need too stay at home to watch movies ima end this by saying movie theaters is not dead
2572,2567,Kendrell Harrison,i can confidently say i probably wouldnt have the same opinion on infinity war and endgame had i not seen them in theaters both are amazing movies on their own but sharing in the highs and lows and all of the suspense with other people was an incredibly powerful moment its probably why there are intheater reactions from those two movies floating around youtube with millions of views and even  years later there are people still watching and commenting on them to relive it all and while i havent had the chance to see no way home i heard it had a similar response
2573,2568,LonelyStar7,the results of the second trolls movie was probably due to also to the fact that there was hardly any new movies coming out

2599,2594,gie,theatres give people something for do a reason to get out the house thats why they live on 
2600,2595,CabMan,nothing beats the experience of watching a movie inside a theater
2601,2596,wazzupthesky, years ago  per ticket  for popcorn only for people to play on their phones and the occasional misbehaving teenagers the theater was crowded but not worth it now its  per ticket on tuesdays and the theater is practically empty so people arent a problem much better however i cant imagine this is sustainable
2602,2597,FABI.,theres nothing like watching a movie on the big screen nothing some movies have to be seen in theaters otherwise the experience wouldnt be the same
2603,2598,Carlos Al-Massih,simply because the joy of watching your favorite movie with total strangers and feel the excitement is the best
2604,2599,Ari Blink 🇺🇦,i think movie theaters for me will always be better for watching brand new movies theres a form of excitement when you watch a movie for the first time ever and you go inside with your popcorn as the lights dim and theres this big screen playing the title cards sharing the same emotion with people like laughing and crying at the same time something that ondemand will never be able to replace
2605,2600,Catherine Springer,i wish you talked about pirating platforms like plex and how they have effected this industry too
2606,2601,SirWilliamification,its really confusing that you guys decided o represent studios with what also looks like a cinema projector
2607,2602,HERNANDEZZ,experiencing a movie with like  other people in a chilly theater makes you feel like you in another world like the movie playing is the only thing that matters
2608,2603,Germano Polito,spiderman no way home after cruella was the first movie i saw at the movie theatre and its an entire different experience
2609,2604,Steve Kountz,because people like getting out of their homes for a night out imagine that

2611,2606,coke,going to theatres with friends is the best feeling ever
2612,2607,Pete .L,why theyre not dead yet cuz the government doesnt want this ritualtype of hollywoods work to come to an end think about it dark room a big screen and theres people there staring at the screen for hours what better ways are there to brainwash people other than news
2613,2608,DebBoi,i refuse to believe that toy story was made in 
2614,2609,Nesr Brn,ive never been in a movie theatre but id like to go one day 
2615,2610,Kraszer,now i am waiting for anime movies to be released for streaming in  months instead of  year when you forget that you wanted to watch it
2616,2611,Code G.I.R.L,i hope and dont think cinema theaters are going away anytime soon unless home cinemas will become affordable
2617,2612,Nikhil Giri,it will end soon or it will get smallershrinklike the real playing grounds are taken over by virtual battlegrounds like that theaters will be taken over by ott and meta theaters
2618,2613,Dana Barakat,i went to almost every harry potter movie premiere at the cinema and it was always such an experience nothing like being with complete strangers but for the same purpose i could never get an experience like that at home nothing like going to the theater especially highly anticipated movies i hope cinemas are here to stay
2619,2614,Just Having Fun,there is still something for me called quotmovie magicquot i step into the theater the lights dim and i participate in a submersive experience no interruptions great sound system the movie was filmed for large format and i can see more detail brbrthe small screen doesnt do this for me ill answer the phone or pause it to get a snack  its not dark and theres a lack of the aura the theater provides brbrhaving said that  tickets are one reason i wasnt going often prepandemic
2620,2615,ShivJ16,i hope theaters stick around you cannot beat the experience watching every movie on your couch at home just becomes boring after a while
2621,2616,MundaneNames,its cause its so expensive for me and my mate its  dollars and then if you want popcorn and a drink literally  dollars netflix is  a month
2622,2617,Nemonie,i dont lile crying from movies but i see other people in the theater crying harder and i feel better
2623,2618,Alex Chai-Hong,theeeterr
2624,2619,kevnev342,in a word they failed to take into account mans almost infinite appetite for distractions huxley
2625,2620,Tycoon Ruler,i hardly go to theaters once a year or two and that too is not guranteed bri simply download the highest quality available and then have an arrangement at home to view the movie however and whenever i want  bradditionally the cost is far too less and most cinema theaters in india do charge a large amount for a movie but the movie theater screen is not that par with the price charged and the modern tvs produce far more better colours and effects and that too from the comforts of the home
2626,2621,larry cuba,i missed being able to see luca and soul and onward but it was released so my fault for not getting to a theater in the  week it was out before the pandemic in theaters  pixar movies need the big screen even seeing the quotkid cheap summerquot movies of movies we own is still fun on the big screen
2627,2622,Soldier09,amazon firestick is the way to go once jailbroken you can watch anything you want for free
2628,2623,Ramprasad A,whatever it may be theyre looting public
2629,2624,Corey,based off the comments seems those producers amp directors complaining about super hero movies not being quotrealquot cinema should bthankb them as they and other blockbusters are the primary driver of people going to theatersbrbrall their whining about streaming not giving the quottrue experiencequot while also begrudging those aforementioned films is a bit ironic either get behind streaming or accept blockbuster films as the main reason people still go to theaters during a pandemic
2630,2625,lp_lux,i still dont get why people complain about super hero movies theyre still amazing movies to watch especially when a movie like spiderman releases thats a great experience to watch that simply cant be the same at home i wish people can stop complaining about them
2631,2626,Kiba the Fang,i need to watch avatar  in a theater no other options i always prefer to watch movie i want to watch as soon as possible in a theater format on tv is just a different experience not as satisfying
2632,2627,Kevin Duliesco,i never go to the cinema as i dont have any money and time but will soon enoughalso i enjoy bluray cds although it takes months to be hd its worth it the only downfall is scratches
2633,2628,Brimz,its really not that hard to watch any movie you want but nowadays many would agree that going to a movie theater is for the experience which you cannot get at home
2634,2629,Kit BRODCATS,your name is a cinema company name
2635,2630,sock,from an international perspective  going to streaming that quickly means movies are instantly available for audiences where they might have had to wait months previously at least in countries that offer those streaming services
2636,2631,Ryan McNeil,you should make a video on how we failed to stop covid
2637,2632,CEEEEEEEEENA,watching avengers and recently spiderman no way home  i would always prefer these big movies in theatres  the experience is amazing cant be replicated  i always watch these big movies in theatres 
2638,2633,Madeline Rosenberger,i have no love for the movie theater experience
2639,2634,Myles Francis Trabado,for me watching in a movie theater is a different kind of experience
2640,2635,Marcos González,hope they never fade
2641,2636,Kimmy Cassie,miss the sound of the theater but honestly i dont remember if movies shown in cinemas had subs if the next movie that i watch in a cinema doesnt have that ill prob just go with the home watching
2642,2637,Noob Master,i like theaters better because it gives a different vibe on the movie
2643,2638,Sayan guria,because we love to scream our lungs out along with dozens of strangers whenever something awesome happening in the movie
2644,2639,Cho Koon,as long as youtube keeps spoiling movies in their thumbnails during the first  days of the movie release theatres arent going anywhere
2645,2640,Honda Ohnaka,i think if the spoiler thumbnails on youtube exist wont it be more convenient to watch wherever you already are like you saw a spoiler spiderman thumbnail you just go to your streaming app to watch it without having to schedule a whole thing for a cinema that also allows people to not get spoiled anymore right
2646,2641,Adif,question why arent there themed theatres instead of only new movies why not classic theatre comedy theatre romance theatre etc
2647,2642,Honda Ohnaka,easier to earn money if everything is under the same roof
2648,2643,ZEY PD, months is still too long so theaters are better
2649,2644,kSwissh007,its all about the experience and movie theaters give the audience a unique experience everytime that cant be duplicated at home streaming services
2650,2645,a l,they really have a point that theatrical releases eventises the film i dont hold the same amount of respect for a film solely released digitally
2651,2646,uuuu260,good vid but i wish you guys went into the numbers how much does a studio make when a movie theater shows the movie how much does a studio make online
2652,2647,OddOneOut665,a href noticed that of the major studios they left out another one with quite a unique deal of their own as well sonybrbrmy memorys sparse on the exact details but they got some kind of deal with netflix where their slate of films from  onward will debut on the service months after theatrical amp digitalphysical and they got another deal with disney giving them permission to stream the marvel films they released namely all the spiderman filmsbrbrdunno why vox left it out as its kind of a big deal as wellbrbredit actually it may be and it may not since upon looking it up theyre choosing to be the only studio in hollywood not to shorten their theatrical window like the others everyones got theirs down to  days while sony is playing the long game which might be  maybe longer if physicaldigital is another window and not part of theatrical
2653,2648,David,i want movie theaters to stay as they provide an enjoyable experience
2654,2649,Alcoda,i saw malignant at home on its release day and it made me so happy that i didnt have to drop  to experience it in theaters just spouse and ibrbrbut then i took my kids to see no way home and it absolutely worth the  and would not have been the same experience at home brbrsome films are just made to experienced on large screens
2655,2650,Joey Baseball,if a movie is good it can be watched on any screen
2656,2651,Mugdalena Crąckowack 🇵🇱 , baseball people have different taste and ask for different experiences most of us would not want to watch avatar through a small smartphone and expect the same experience that the director want to give
2657,2652,Joey Baseball, crckowack   so then you only watch it once and never again are you gonna rent out a movie theater if you wanted to watch it a second time
2658,2653,Goodlooka,im all for streaming movies at home especially cause i dont have an imax in my city that would be my only reason for going to the theater at this point to see the movie as the director wanted it
2659,2654,uma.u,theaters and movie theaters are my safe place i hope theyre never dead
2660,2655,Ariel Shpitzer,do you got k screen   speakers sorround sound system brbruntill youll own those  movie theaters will be way better
2661,2656,Isabela Oliveira,really interesting essay
2662,2657,Yufeng yan,lol
2663,2658,Yufeng yan,lol
2664,2659,Matthew Walton,as a young person i dont find a movie any more highvalue because it was released in theaters for me it makes no difference whether a movie is exclusively shown in theaters on streaming iandi in theaters simultaneously or streaming only after all isausage partyi had a theatrical release did it not i judge a movies quality based on the movie itself not the format in which it is released to an audience i dont doubt that im in the minority here but as times change and more generations are raised watching netflix hulu and amazon prime i have a feeling that a growing share of the population will feel as i do and to be honest i think theaters are overrated anyway  i can watch a film here at home on my  dolby surround sound k television on my own couch with a better selection of snacks and no need to pay for overpriced popcorn iandi i dont have to travel any farther than my living room to me its almost a certainty that movie theaters are on their last legs and it wont be more than a few decades before they become what blockbuster is to us today thats my prediction at least and quite frankly i think well all be better off for it i know i will
2665,2660,Honda Ohnaka,based
2666,2661,OS10100,theaters are using things like dbox imax d etc to keep customers coming back however with the omicron variant now you cant even eat in the theater ontario and have to keep your mask on that negates from the movie going experience so yeah i have no idea how long they can keep this up sooner of later it would be cheaper to just shut down if this trend continues th th th wave of the variant etc everyone knows that the popcorn nachos candy etc etc make up majority of the profits for movie theaters without that revenue stream they are doomed
2667,2662,Gokul S,my question is why movie theater should be dead no one can replace its experience of this entertainment
2668,2663,Biniyam,movie theaters show that us as humans can come together peacefully
2669,2664,Nina Tran,nothing can beat going to the theaters but i only go now a days if the movie is really worth seeing in theaters because of prices
2670,2665,ramaxeiei เnwzaØØ7_XDr da dead King彡 ✨ ⚪,cuz hbo made hbo go  max and disney made disney that made people can wait for streaming that easier and faster then before
2671,2666,Raphael,the last movie i saw at the cinema was jumanji the next level in december  its so hard to believe cinemas were just shut from my life like thatbri miss it a bit

2674,2669,Varad Bhandare,avengers infinity war avengers endgame and spiderman no way home wouldnt be the icons they are today without the theater
2675,2670,Siddhant Choudhury,oh god one day our generation will have kids and we will have to tell them about going to theatres like our parents used to talk about going to discos or getting vhs tapes
2676,2671,Alsa,tenet
2677,2672,Andrew Weilandt,watching a movie is an event so i dont think they will ever go away
2678,2673,MJB Games,good luck in  ad with your  light year tall television screen only for that to get dwarfed by a movie theater screen that is basically infinity tall ill wait 
2679,2674,New Beginning,i will always support the theater 
2680,2675,louison dessus,in france the time between the theatrical window and release to dvd and streaming is legally regulated which is one of the things that helps keep the movie theatres alive also its overall a lot cheaper to go than in the us and the culture encourage it a lot more 
2681,2676,Sanchit Jain,me watching the video title on  december  be likebrquotcuz spidermanquot
2682,2677,Mimicu,there is no comparison watching films in theaters is the best experience 
2683,2678,Jarrod Lamp,when i want to the theaters on thanksgiving amp xmas day only i was in the moive theater the theaters are dying just like the malls at end of the day i like watch moive at home not dealing with ppls cell phones packed bad seats babies crying my oled tv home theater are the best no need for outdated moive theaters
2684,2679,Vic,after movies like avengers endgame and spiderman no way homethe theatrical experience cannot be replicated studios should focus on making great movies people want to see everything else can go to streaming
2685,2680,Saad Nabil,digital streaming is terrible
2686,2681,Siberian Moschid,immersion
2687,2682,Sebastiaan Krul,i feel like godzilla vs kong had to be mentioned as it revived theathres when they were at its lowest
2688,2683,dinkyvision,ive always been a huge movie geek often going to theaters  times a month in years past i love a huge screen amp pro audio system but since the pandemic as i am a high risk individual i have no desire to go anytime soon the last few years has had an increase in annoying audiences with talking checking bright phones in dark theaters etc ive also been somewhat of an audio video geek my entire life in the late s amp early s our family got a decent surround system when i was about  early s i had setup a entry level surround sound system in my bedroom over the years i upgraded to better systems higher end speakers dolby surround to dts amp  once i had moved out of my parents house i always had a mid level or better digital  setup which then evolved to a higher end  system i always designed my viewing area to optimize the experience between controlling light window treatments indirect dimmable lighting acoustic treatments seating etc as well as a large hd television since we arent going to theaters we used the money we would have spent on movie nights to upgrade to a large flagship oled  sony bravia master series k oled hdr paired with an atmos  audio system definitive technologies pro cinema  surrounds  for atmos height channels  center amp supercube  subwoofer driven by a sony atmos amp running  watts we also added hue sync active backlighting with  light bars behind the monitor as well as outfitted the majority of the house with hue bulbs now we can hit an automation and have the rooms lights dim to low levels with the active backlights casting an extremely immersive effect behind the tv which to me is far more immersive than d its a fantastic setup at home free of annoying ppl distracting from the movie and we can have amazing snacks or cocktails whenever without outrageous prices i love the shorter release windows amp will gladly subscribe to many streaming services amp pay for digital releases to enjoy at home
2689,2684,Ohana Lee,cinema is experience creator not only by its visual but sound and other aspect that maybe we dont have in home
2690,2685,duckjail,i could not be more ready for the fall of theaters and a future of streaming on small screens

2698,2693,Al Koholic,because theres nothing like the big screen i love the theaters and i doubt it will ever go away
2699,2694,ΛᄂƬΣЯПΛƬΣ ƬΉΣӨЯY,ah this is a half baked video missing some critical facts and not representing both sides neutrallybrvod  is the future and theatre in all honesty theatre should be considered a relic of the past given their sneaky pricing and monopolizing audiences vod no doubt gives audiences more variety of content encouraging indie directors to show their creativity
2700,2695,Brent V,guess its a case to case situation with some movies still going straight to streaming premium on demand rental and other methods or recently encanto which was in theatres for just a month until disney put it on their streaming service
2701,2696,Diana B,a href omg encanto came out on thanksgiving and then was released on disney on december  that was such a short window
2702,2697,Aryan Verma,cinemas theaters will never be dead no matter how good netflix or prime is but seeing that movie in theater has a whole new emotion that nothing in this world can top that
2703,2698,dablet,its just bizarre how theaters are still alive even through the pandemicbri stopped going to the theaters because i was tired of teens on their phones getting shot in theater bringing bed bugs home and that annoying baby crying from somewhere
2704,2699,Jarrod Lamp,dame true ott are best
2705,2700,Saeed Khan,movie theaters are so special there is nothing like getting ready and going to see a good movie with a bunch of random strangers i dont want a world where we will watch new movies alone at home and talk about them on social media it takes to much from wholesome human interaction
2706,2701,Jules H.,as someone who gets terrible headaches with being in a dark room looking at one bright screen and having very loud music played i am super grateful that movies are coming to home options sooner nowadays than back in the toy story era bri just dont fare well and prefer my tv having another light source and the option to stop if a headache is oncoming and finish when i feel better bradditionally i prefer getting some friends together watching at home with our own drinks and snacks just like we want  and at half the costbrbrbut i would never want anyone else to miss out on the epic movie experience it is truly so very different you cant deny that
2707,2702,Chicocalte,people who have contagious laughs in the movie theater makes the jokes even funnier you cant replace that
2708,2703,JuiceBoy XD,im sorry but im always gonna enjoy seeing a big movie release for the first time in a big movie theatre rather than at home on my tv
2709,2704,Maximilian Martinez,meanwhile i absolutely despise the theater experience why should i have to watch a movie crammed into a box with a bunch of strangers having to endure the stench of some unholy quotnachoquot concoction wafting over from the next row hearing someones kids endlessly causing a racket despite it not being a kids movie with someone inevitably jiggling their foot and causing the whole row of cheap plastic uncomfortable seats to vibrate i only go to theaters when dragged to it by my friends and regret it every time its a million times better to watch a movie in the quiet peaceful comfort of my own house whenever i hear about theater exclusives especially in a bglobal pandemic that is  not over yet and probably never will be at this rateb i lose all interest in the movie until it happens to make its way to streaming id honestly be elated if the theater industry as a whole disappeared because of this pandemic
2710,2705,Nurolight,honestly i just want same day releases i just want to be able to watch the film the way i want to depending on the film sure that may shrink the amount of cinemas available  but thatll just bring cinemas into a more specialised group itll make the event films feel bigger like going to see a broadway show
2711,2706,Sari Moskowitz,especially if its a movie ive been waiting for ages to see like spiderman nothing can beat sitting in a theater opening weekend with tons of fans surrounding you reacting to every thing that happens
2712,2707,Drishtant Rai,after watching spider man nonway home i will say they will stay forever and growing stronger than ever

2714,2709,MIKE D,theyre just fun
2715,2710,Sarojinee Tripathy,take it from me a person who watched movies throughout the pandemic on netflix and amazon  the immersive and majestic experience i got from spider man no way home in the theater is much better than that in my home but i would definitely agree with someone who prefers the comfort and coziness of home to watch a romantic or comedy or movies of any goofy genres 
2716,2711,KID SOUL,cuz the experience hits
2717,2712,Joey Baseball,to all the people saying the movie theater is the only way yo watch a movie why even own a dvd player
2718,2713,I WANT MY SLAW!!,how about you go back to making movies worth actually watching some people have taste and would like to watch something other than marvel movies
2719,2714,Jimmy Ramone, weeks later spiderman  fixed everything
2720,2715,Nicolas Rios,answer spiderman no way home amp marvel are keeping movie theaters alive
2721,2716,Blankclz,spiderman just made a billion at the box office
2722,2717,Faizal Firdaus,i think you may extendrenew your content with the box office number performance amp streaming performance at the end of brbrwb is the only studio to practise sameday release on hbo max amp theatres amp their box office numbers clearly show i dont know their side of hbo max new users tho brbrdisney changed its policy on releasing sameday on disney premiere access after numbers of free guy amp definitely helps shangchi eternalsbrbrspiderman no way home even becomes the st movie to reach usdbn in the pandemic
2723,2718,A Captain Nachoz,after watching no way home at the theaters it wouldnt have been the same at all if i watched it on my couch
2724,2719,Beau Biden,i ask the same thing about my dad
2725,2720,B Boy,by  cinemas will be as common as blockbuster video today
2726,2721,Anurag Kaushish,idk about anyone else but for the last  films i went to cinemas for i left the cinema hall after  minutes my attention span due to social media would never allow me to watch anything more than  minutes ps i didnt even watch this video
2727,2722,Andrei Sousa,that will be so sad if happens
2728,2723,Alessandro,great video as always
2729,2724,Based,its expected that they totally will be in about the next decade but some will still be around though nonetheless
2730,2725,CollegeDegree,going to the theaters is more of an experience now the standard tv and audio setup in a middle class home is going up steadily and projectors are becoming large sellers for entertainment areas to recreate the theater at home a lot of business depends on relationships the theaters were lucky to have had a long standing relationship with studios it doesnt serve studios well to not release digitally the same day when looking at netflixs success with tv shows though their movies are growing much larger with greater focus twitter ig facebook tiktok etc can spread the word of a new hit in a streaming service so quickly to generate massive overnight profits that theaters dont stand a chance in a debate on which is more valuable to a studio but old relationships and the good ole this is how weve always done it has saved theaters for nowbrbreven with home theater setups becoming much grander over time theaters are still an experience that the general public isnt done with studios saw the demand for it to come back and agreed to save the experience but even studios cant help a growing trend of less people going to the movies the theatrical window has shrunk for a reason and its because movies shelf life in a theater has shortened and profits dry up quickly on anything that isnt a superherostar warspixar style movie that window continues to shorten as consumer sentiment changes and just like malls less and less people find the experience of going out to be less of a fun way to spend their time online shopping digital experiences and goods are on the rise at alarming rates over the last  years in the end theaters will continue to struggle and shut down across the us as they already were i live in maine and ive seen  theaters close within a hr radius of my home its now a min drive one way to a theater one that im not sure will survive much longer based on the traffic in the area needless to say i now have a nice surround sound system installed and a projector for those awesome big movie events with the family sad as i used to go to the movies at least once a month but will never become a regular movie goer again
2731,2726,Полина Чернина,also living in a cold nothern country going to the cinema is one of the few ways to have fun in winter haha
2732,2727,William Côté,one simple explanation is the number of movie made now a days compare to br movie in brbut  in 
2733,2728,Alexander Misyurina,amc to the moon 
2734,2729,Aprime,what about matrix
2735,2730,Demmrir,thread is full of people who quotlove going to the theaterquot and defending it but let me ask you this if the theater is such a better experience why does the theatrical release window need to exist at all if people are willing to put up with the scheduling cost and surrounding context of a theatrical viewing then there doesnt need to be an exclusive window that window proves that even theaters know theyre a worse experience than home viewings on some level
2736,2731,Joey Baseball,its the same as people who hate spoilers but then watch the same movie  times in theaters the first week why bother watching it a second time you already know all the spoilers
2737,2732,TheNicePerson 22,i saw two movies last year but they were before the pandemic hit i was gonna watch jungle cruise and free guy when they came out in the summer of last year but they were delay in end of november i was gonna see croods  but our theater was closed until it was reopened in february  then i saw croods  and  movies that came out this year i think spent to much on going see movies next year i will spend probably  on going to the movies than this year
2738,2733,Nartworks,definitely would say that spiderman no way home has been a big help to revive this
2739,2734,David Dima,not everyone have expensive big high resolution tv and amazing sound system at their home to enjoy movies thats why watching in cinemas are better options
2740,2735,avinash verma,i would always choose ott
2741,2736,ObeyMePlz,haha true asf
2742,2737,jbroti 004,i find that when i see a movie in theaters whatever the emotions the directoractors are looking to pull out of me sadness laughter applause etc become amplified and more memorable when im among other people providing a greater experience and more appreciation for a movie brbrplus streaming will eventually hit its own peak and have consequences that will need to be addressed and changed were already seeing every network and their mother creating their own streaming platform making what used to an affordable  a month easy purchase into an expensive venture paying that much for  platforms
2743,2738,Will Bainbridge,i went to the cinema for the first time since the pandemic hit in september and have been back  times since the movie theatre experience is simply irreplaceable and no home theatre set up can truly match the vibe and experience the cinema has
2744,2739,nazh kun,movie theatre cant never be dead the experience is different
2745,2740,R S2002,poor job voxbrbrwhybrbr you miss the fact that universal have agreed to extend big title movies from  days to  days if they demonstrate strong box office takings this was evident for movies like fbrbr throughout the theatrical window it is established that virtually all movies make  of their total box office in the first  days thus reducing the window to  days isnt a problem it in fact helps the situation by allowing more regular movie going and its no secret that more movies are releasedbrbrstreaming is a tv experience which also differs significantly from the big screen theatrical onebrbrfurther more the cinema is an art form in its own right and isnt going anywhere brbrspider man no way home has demonstrated this very recently
2746,2741,Cedrick Binuya,i believe theres also a disadvantage with releasing in theaters and digital format at the same time piracy is a very big business in the internet and thats a major loss for studios
2747,2742,Navi Aulakh,bullish for amc
2748,2743,Danny Boiii,i pray that cinema prevails
2749,2744,Alex,ott are best
2750,2745,A22DNAL,reruns are for home watching i want the first bestinclass experience on opening day at my local cinema so i can appreciate all that cinematography entails point blank period
2751,2746,Chris h,because going to the movies is amazing and i will never get tired of it
2752,2747,har,spiderman and james bond films are the proof that cinemas are not dead
2753,2748,xele fonte,bthat part atb a href bwhere he said streaming customers view theatrical releases more highly cause its about the experience uhh yeah thats what blockbuster thought when it came to renting movies that people love nothing more than wasting their gas to be around strangers who may or may not rewind the movie all the while getting a crippling late fee if returned a minute late no we hate that and blockbuster learned the hard way movie theatres about to get a dose of harsh reality very soon especially when k  tvs are becoming the normb
2754,2749,Beenticulate,movie theaters are expensive if you are paying for not just yourself i think the movie theater business will become more specialized they will cater toward movies like dune and tenet where you need those movie theater immersions to really enjoy it
2755,2750,praveen dubbaka,spiderman no way home is the perfect movie to see in the theatres and not online
2756,2751,L.M,bullish for amc stonk 
2757,2752,Klion,funnily enoughi watched the trolls movie in a frigging theater in india on its release
2758,2753,MrZampo,i think no way home just proved again that cinema experience isnt going away
2759,2754,TBNPrathades,lets be real the reason is because i hate getting spoiler thats why i watch no way home shang chi and etc on theater
2760,2755,Marlon Moncrieffe, ah this video totally reminded me that the matrix resurrections is on hbo max i was almost going to go see it in theaters
2761,2756,HypnovaFPS,i mean you cant beat movie theaters experience
2762,2757,Bordel Mama,works for me
2763,2758,Harrison Allen,the world of cinema will live on for years to come
2764,2759,DotADBX,i believe the best system would be a shared risk shared profit scheme increase already expensive movie tickets and make the experience more of an event rather then just going to the movies in exchange theaters collectively invest in studios projects so they get a cut of the pie regardless of if people go to theaters or not this keeps the  split intact this allows theaters to share theatrical release dates with streaming dates same day with basically zero lossbrbrtheaters get to charge more and will have more financial incentive to make going to the movies a better over all experience and studios get to maximize profits sooner  with no wait window and best of all we win the movie watcher gets to view the movie how we want when we want where we want like we have always wanted
2765,2760,Carlos Spiceyweiner,what does my head in is that only blockbusters like the mcu reboots and bond are the only films people will go to the cinema to see brbrfilms like the last duel failed
2766,2761,Luis Garcia,amc  d moon
2767,2762,L.M,yessir

2769,2764,Deneen DeMaio,braveheart was the last movie we saw in a theater lol
2770,2765,L.M,missing out theaters
2771,2766,Chaddington Bear,heres a short answer because we love theaters
2772,2767,ava,the dramatic music in this video is so funny
2773,2768,Dee Yanase,im living in a big city the moviegoers etiquettes and behavior are so bad  like talking and texting during movie so i stopped going to movie theaters and i dont miss it at all the extinction is inevitable
2774,2769,Light Soda,that smell of the popcorn as you walk into a theatre i never even buy the popcorn we always bring our own snacks in but nothing can replace that aroma when you smell it you know its about the go down
2775,2770,Light Soda,nothing can replace the feeling of watching a movie in the cinema with everyone else nothing it is akin to being in a stadium while sport is playing or a concert when a musician is on for that moment in time you and everyone there has forgotten that the world exists
2776,2771,ghost Compton,spiderman no way home discuss it
2777,2772,oansun,the theatrical window of batman forever was june to october 
2778,2773,Metaphor,cinemas will never go away just expect better snacks better waittime entertainment and more competitive price
2779,2774,noname,well in my city  movie theaters have already gone bankrupt
2780,2775,Skinsomnia,letting go of movie theatres would be like letting go of gamestop weve already lost blockbuster were not losing theaters

2785,2780,NELOY SINHA,theatres arent dyingcause i aint watching avengers  or spiderman  in a tiny box
2786,2781,Olivio Sarikas,man i hate these kind of videos like quotwant to know what might happen soon let me start at the beginning of recorded history waste your time for  of the video then end with the question from the titlequot
2787,2782,Ike Acha, words amc alist
2788,2783,L.M,amc  da moon 
2789,2784,Tatiana Teixeira,watching movies like avengers infinity war  endgame and spiderman nwh in a sold out in theaters was an experience it self  something that you will never have it at home
2790,2785,Allison Navarro,they should make kid movie release on the same day on both platforms digital and cinema and the rest of the movies release on different days
2791,2786,Kevin Patel,they do
2792,2787,Vojtěch Rod,i cant comment the situation in the us and i think the situation is different there but total numbers in european cinemas declined basically every year even before the pandemic i am quite good example of quottypical european consumerquot when i was a teenager i visited a cinema about  times per month i visited cinema recently after several years now and i could say i see less and less ppl in front of multiplexes basically every year i personally think if they dont  bring something new about cinemas most of them will close during several years the pandemic just make it faster
2793,2788,Dark Frost,phones computers and tvs are convenient but nothing can match the quality of cinema the gigantic screen and the deafening sound cannot be replicated
2794,2789,zaltmanbleroze,the gigantic screen no but with a decent surround set you can definitely recreate a very good and deafening sound the whole neighbourhood can enjoy
2795,2790,Doctor Panigrahi,d movie is a scam
2796,2791,Owen Copson,that pet hair at the  min mark is responsible for  of my screen smudges
2797,2792,Vagabond,the movie theatre is honestly a different experience i went yesterday to watch the new spiderman and i was completely lost in the movie and didnt realized i was watching a movie until the end
2798,2793,ELIAS GREYSON,because a good movie theater is unmatched the bfi imax here is never not fully booked if yours is good people will go
2799,2794,Faiq Abiyyannn,on my consumptive perspective the thought of watching a movie not in cinema theatre would always be boring and far less valuable first time i see movies back in cinema post pandemic it just feels unreal and rather heartwarming to finally able to sit in cinema again cinema is an irreplaceable sensation most definitely
2800,2795,WhiteTylerPerry,i stopped caring about cinemas years ago when netflix streaming started growing its catalogbr the idea of paying to watch something once br not being able to pause for a bathroom break or a phone call br its a lot cheaper for me to make my own snacks and invite people over to watch a new releases than it is for everyone to buy a ticket and buy  sodas with way too much ice brif there was a subscription model for going to the movies i might pay for that instead because i could get my moneys worth if i wantbrcinemas are a thing of the past and much like quotbrick and mortarquot retail these companies have had ample time to see the writing on the wall and adapt
2801,2796,GameThrone,because of films like spiderman
2802,2797,Max Power,part  how sony broke the mold with spiderman
2803,2798,diana gabriella,after seeing spiderman no way home its pretty clear that the movie theater experience is still something that can never and will never be replicated it was electric
2804,2799,R S2002,
2805,2800,OBXhiker05,ha ha electric get it  cause electro lol
2806,2801,Lord Xeno, 
2807,2802,Brando43770,agreed and opening weekend vs any other week affects the energy of the audience opening weekend is the best as everyone is a fan of the franchise and will either show love or disappointment for the movie location matters too as ive been to theaters where no one reacts to anything because theyre just talking and drinking during the movie and not really paying attention because theyre not fans of the series
2808,2803,Michael Morales,yup it was amazing
2809,2804,natnat, lol
2810,2805,Curt Randall,theaters cannot afford to remain open just for marvel movies though   while the big marvel movie of the year does pack theaters due to their loyalty of a massive younger demographic most other movies in between have had too many empty theaters especially now   this is not sustainable for the industry   and if this continues hollywood will make fewer and fewer movies for the theater   the outlook still looks bleak
2811,2806,Angie Roxy, maybe
2812,2807,Porch Turds,it wasnt a good movie actually it was predictable
2813,2808,Steakfilly, pls dont spoil
2814,2809,Steakfilly, turds based
2815,2810,Brady Tan,vr could replace it i think
2816,2811,Cam Alex, turds it was a good movie but yes alot was predictable except the ending
2817,2812,Cam Alex, tan do u like nausea migranes and a strained neck 
2818,2813,Hassaan Qureshi,truebrit made b global shows the power of theatre
2819,2814,Olivia Wilson,especially on opening night the raw reaction of everyone in the room is just so satifying to be apart of
2820,2815,CollinTheBirthdayBoy,bruh you cant even have popcorn that not even remotely good compared to before i bet you enjoy biden doing this to us not letting us even have a good because of this and we are even social distancing in the theatre as well
2821,2816,Olivia Wilson, its just temporary its not forever just think back to when things were better until we go back to normal
2822,2817,Sage Bias,wait until you get a great home theater it changes everything
2823,2818,Braylon Hofford, turds i like the movie who agrees with me
2824,2819,Absak,yeah but i already have theater at home
2825,2820,_Bagginshield,and then there are people like me who cant even see it because my country is in lockdown and the movie theaters are closed
2826,2821,OBXhiker05, dude he is in the trailers
2827,2822,Yahboiii,amazing experience
2828,2823,Truth Be Told,say it again
2829,2824,Code G.I.R.L,talking about spiderman i deeply regret not watching into the spider verse  in the theaters because when i watched it on my laptop i knew it would never compare watching it on a big screen with d glasses but now that the second movie is coming out i have a second chance 
2830,2825,ItsMaha,i disagreed about the same as being home with my surround sound
2831,2826,s o f i a,yess its awesome
2832,2827,the Rabbit Whisper,get a home theater system and you will think differently
2833,2828,Albert Chhab, randall i only go for the nonmarvel films
2834,2829,Cat anada,you should have seen dune in theaters
2835,2830,Eddie Rios,very true
2836,2831,ien,agreed something about being hype with the other people in the theatre about characters coming back got me super excited it was awesome
2837,2832,ololh4xx,i can replicate that with a decent large tv and powerful sound equipment easily everyone can
2838,2833,Robert Power,i prefer a deal silent atmosphere so i can really appreciate i hate when everyone is chattering or cheering a movie
2839,2834,Narja,i wouldve enjoyed the movie more at home tbh i dont like random people cheering for minutes on end
2840,2835,lakshya varshney,thats true for so many movies across so many genres
2841,2836,Raul Bustos,except for the part where people now clap at scenes as if the cast or the director were there 
2842,2837,Brandon Janicki,yes but with that has come a whole new problem will movie theatres only survive because of mindless superhero movies or will we actually get too see good pure cinema again
2843,2838,Alma Vöge,the spiderman films with tom holland is overrated those from the s are the best and will probably always be
2844,2839,River Twygz bed, rabbit whisper not everyone is rich
2845,2840,The Bearded Seeker,as much as i wanted to see it there was no way i was going to step foot in a theatre with omicron on the hunt for new flesh nope will just have to wait until its available to stream or rent
2846,2841,David Mitchell,uh yeah obviously i knew that from the getgo
2847,2842,AA SS,you can replicate it just buy a huge color accurate tv and some surrounded sound system youll basically get the same thing if you know how to correctly set it up

2852,2847,bigby2k, bearded seeker theres also the various torrent sites
2853,2848,Tony Murrietta,definitely movie theater was lit when nwh came out 
2854,2849,Anu,it was very annoying for me everyone was screaming every  seconds couldnt hear the dialogues half the time
2855,2850,Phillip B,disagree that movie was garbage
2856,2851,Jazzling,that movie had no substance just look at this radical character
2857,2852,kungebbe,idk but i didnt like it probably because i got spoiled right before watching it
2858,2853,Jack Ehaus,i saw it opening night and let me say that was an experience lol people were ready for that
2859,2854,Lance Vangen,movie was trash
2860,2855,Witte Verheul,i will abstain from watching no way home until theaters re open
2861,2856,Squicx,spiderman single handedly saved theatres
2862,2857,Roger,i personally like watching movies on my oled with the dobly atmos on its bussin oled is the future
2863,2858,totoroben,i think the last film i saw in theaters was zootopia  i have noticed the dvd release window being shortened to three months because i set reminders to reserve them from the library  watching new release on blu ray is good enough for me
2864,2859,Jonna King,ill always love theaters the theater experience is not only about the movie its about getting out of the house seeing people having dinner maybe getting snacks watching previews and the movie  nothing compares to midnight showings streaming will never replicate the theater experience  yeah im gen x all the way
2865,2860,CezrDaPleazr,this year has had some great movies been at the theater easily at least  times this year

2867,2862,McDee McDeener,i will keep them alive by myself if i have too
2868,2863,Heber,what if big companies like disney sony paramount etc created their own movie theaters and put their movies exclusively  on their own theaters
2869,2864,Fallout Boy,the paramount decision where studios could not own theaters was actually reversed they can do this now its just really expensive
2870,2865,Heber, boy so what if they do would this cause theaters to flop harder or would this only end big companies like amc
2871,2866,ptit biscuit, word  popcorn
2872,2867,Fy,its a good experience when you watch a movie with a lot of people
2873,2868,Angelo Lorenzo,theaters are for escapism streaming services are for comfort both are vital for human psychological needs
2874,2869,Nash Winston,never underestimate the one group that will always have a need to go to movie theaters  its not the cinephiles or the layman its not the mcu buffs or art house folks its couples whos idea of a date will always be going out for dinner and a movie
2875,2870,zaltmanbleroze,but when theatres fade they can skip that part and go straight for the boom shakalaka boom
2876,2871,Muhammad Jesus Wong,great visuals the way the gaps are portrayed really helps
2877,2872,Marcus Carana,imagine choosing to watch films like mcu films godzilla interstellar the dark knight trilogy fast and furious etc in the living room or on your phone instead of the a big screen theatre with epic surround sound well thats the answer for this video
2878,2873,Rayn Kakum,buy amc
2879,2874,Mark Ryan Francisco,xbjsusu
2880,2875,Joël Jimenez,honestly i wouldnt mind if there were no cinemas since  ive only been to avengers infinity war amp endgame to prevent myself from getting spoiled besides that i dont see the benefit of going to the cinema if youre a binge watcher of movies especially series
2881,2876,Max Salazar,i can see why people would want to just be able to rent movies and watch them at home we saw it during the pandemic and its totally understandable and even convenient at times but the experience you get from going to a movie theatre is irreplaceable and cant be replicated unless you have a state of the art theatre at your home which most people dont brin my opinion movie theaters are never going away if anything theyll evolve into something even better but for now their foundation is rock solid
2882,2877,Jonna King,even with a state of the art home theater id still wanna get out of the house thats part of the fun of it just like if i had a  star personal chef in my home id still wanna go out to eat
2883,2878,clint edwards,wish we could go back  years and still have blockbuster that was an experience i dont want to go through that again
2884,2879,A. H.,personally i cant wait to go back to a theater ill go to my grave as a loyal customer even though i see its death with the vr technology as being its inevitable demise
2885,2880,Anonymous,hey everyone d i hope you stay safe and have a nice day god bless you lt
2886,2881,Shubham Tripathi,lets not forget the inevitability of vr and metaverse when talking about the future of theatrical presentation of movies while at present blockbusters can be best enjoyed in theatres owing to their superior immersiveness and social experience vr presentation has the potential to change this dynamic drastically with potentially more immersion and more personal sensory stimulation theatres would really need to evolve to compete perhaps even integrate some of these personalised immersive technologies themselves
2887,2882,Paraone Ngatai,i dont think cinemas will or should go as the experience can be experienced with others watching no way home in theaters was something else
2888,2883,Shreynick Rathod,theatre experience is not comparablebrpersonally i like to watch movies in theatre
2889,2884,Useless Duck Company,its probably because i used to be a projectionist but it drives me nuts that the talking head graphics used the wrong type of film in this video

2892,2887,History & Mythology Explained,is it safe to go to theatre since the virus is spreading im going to no way home to theatre tomorrow but im kinda afraid whether id get coronasince the omicron variant is spreading fast and ive already got corona once and got cured
2893,2888,Nischal Subba,long live theatresfor movie lovers like me
2894,2889,Matt Mirza,i couldnt go to the theatre so i bought quotvenom let there be carnagequot recently for  on prime  ive since watched it with  different sets of people on my projector at home  they brought over food we stopped the movie halfway to go to bathroom refill our drinks  however i watched dune in ultraavx at a theatre just cause i felt like it  i think you should release it for both at the same time and let the consumer decide
2895,2890,Hamdi Mohammed Taha Hasnain,metaverse can change this
2896,2891,petespanchos,i hate that were in a timeline where trolls world tour is a landmark moment in the history of cinema
2897,2892,Abhiraaj singh,the real art of cinema experience lies in big theatre screens 
2898,2893,Golden Vulture,may movie theaters never become extinct
2899,2894,Nicolás Jiménez García,good video but itd be good if they dived more into the reasons why theaters are important to studios
2900,2895,Manuel Montero,im sorry but experiencing a movie in theaters will never be comparable to do it on a tv i can definitely appreciate rewatching it sooner but i will always prefer watching it before in theaters
2901,2896,E D,the pandemic imposed an evolutionarily change on the entire entertainment industry from inception to consumption movies tvshows and now the metaverse  is at a major cross road entrainment factories need to revaluate what kind of content they want to produce solely on the platform of consumption and no two formats are alike the two closes platform of viewing is the big screen and the living room screen all other screens and will becoming and stand alone format  without cross over  my netflix will not be shared content with my metaverse screen or viceversa fragmentation will be the future of media consumption
2902,2897,NotOrrio,i think thearters are more for the experience where you get to go watch a movie and eat food

2909,2904,Ali Dangou,play anime movies
2910,2905,Gaurav Raut,a theatre experience will always be my favourite theatre have that big feeling to it i dont know if that explains it correctly but my point is if youre watching a cinematic masterpiece like dune interstellar or something with great action scenes like endgame or the new spiderman movie the theatre experience will be unmatched but sadly because of netflix disney prime video people are watching movies online and because of that there is less and less croud in cinemas at one point theatres will shut down 
2911,2906,Jag-Verse,until a virtual theatre comes out
2912,2907,Gino Cerda,movie theaters arent dead yet because spiderman just came out
2913,2908,suryadi taufan,no way home prove that people still watch on theatres or cinema

2921,2916,Himblerk's Adventures,this is similar to the restaurant and order by an app i think you can order your meal with an app but when you want to enjoy a delicious meal and socialise with your friends you go to a restaurant same as movies you can watch the film in your house but when it is a good movie you want to go to the cinema with friends have popcorn and enjoy the night
2922,2917,Donovan Taylor,yea theyre good for publicity
2923,2918,Ken,so the pandemic has provided a dramatic change in every aspect of entertainment this point of time might be the opportunity to become more advanced and as the years go by theaters might become totally obsolete in the future
2924,2919,Cook N Crook,the pandemic almost killed them off i hope they make a full return
2925,2920,JustChan,i think if theaters shut down forever it would due more harm than good because people who pirate some or all movies and dont watch cam recorded movies can now watch any movie that comes out in free and hd

2934,2929,Mikaela Mooke,watching certain movies at home does not even come close to comparing to the theaters if theres a great movie coming out im going to the movies to see it because of the experience i think if anything people realized during covid how much we missed going out to the theaters convince is great and easy but if youre a true movie lover going to the movies is irreplaceable maybe not as many people go but i believe there here to stay especially for big movies like marvel and most recently dune
2935,2930,Saving Alice,lol ok so instead of waiting a month two release it online they litterally had to release some of the movies a month earlier in the rest of the world  brbri watched dune  times before it even came in theatres in the us
2936,2931,Gedalyah Reback,movie theaters still have to read the writing on the wall and start diversifying blockbuster missed that opportunity against netflix regal and co dont have to
2937,2932,a stranger on the internet,tldr nothing will ever beat the immersive experience of being in a theater not even your home
2938,2933,Wiktor Jachyra,i think this could probably be a monopoly lawsuit in the futurewith the studios only offering it on their streaming the goverment might see that as killing competition with the closer of theaters
2939,2934,Vanoni Motors,i work at a cinemark and at my theater it is almost exclusively people over  years old i do not know how we make any money as we rely on concessions and only a bit from the tickets i heard about  but we dont get any marvel for the first  weeks as a young person i dont see a great future for a movie theater
2940,2935,Skyrim Marvel,i remember watching movies at theater during lockdown in end year  its was only me watching movie in theater so sad to see empty theater but hopefully coming year  all of us can watch movie at theater once again like old days

2946,2941,Rocket & Groot,bman people have been asking if movie theaters are dying for yearsb
2947,2942,Rohit Banga,i love wtaching movies in theaters it is a more than just watching a movie it is an entire evening of going out dining amp enjoying if it is a particularly good film like dune then i actually prefer watching it with family in my home theater with a projector but if it is a fun date movie then nothing beats hundreds of people fully immersed clapping amp enjoying themselves
2948,2943,Davis Designs,honestly i just dont feel like watching some movies on my tv
2949,2944,MJunction,great video but i feel like this is missing the movie makers angle where so many visionaries want that big screen experience for their work
2950,2945,Haris Naufal,nah i think that the feeling of going to cinema having a more different experience directors vision imax ceremonial experience superior audio quality etc etc is just a marketing gimmick and nostalgia trap to convince people to go there filmakers should make movies for smartphone users in mind not gatekeeping them in the quotso called large screenquot that everyone cant ownbrbr cinema is facing their downfall and they should be innovating more people watch movies in their home more than in cinema because of the convenience cinema cant offer that kind of comfort
2951,2946,Jakub Chwieduk,watching something in imax make sens but in the age of k more more affordable oled tvs and home sound systems i think cinemas will be less popular in the future they need to step up the game regarding the quality of the film

2958,2953,sujal Salgarkar,even if theatres and streaming service had same date i would still prefer theatres for its immersive experience even if i had a netflix subscription
2959,2954,luis esparza,the majority of people dont have a decent sound system and thats half the movie experience right there watching a movie for the first time on your small tv phone or laptop is pointless you need a large screen and theater quality audio with dune for example i saw it in theaters and at home and the experience was a hundred times better in theaters

2967,2962,Marc Likes Pigeons,the incredible use of audio in last night in soho would be completely lost watching from a tv and same as many movies also the immersion is generally better in cinemas i find with louder and better audio bigger screens etc

2974,2969,DP DP,sometimes people want to enjoy with high quality format sound and visual small electronics home devices doesnt provide this
2975,2970,Rahela Shikorina,there were two people killed at the same theater in the same city that i used to go to as well theater needs to end theres kids around this is unnecessary when alot of stuff is evolving today

2985,2980,Mo Hussain,there is no better way to watch a movie than at a cinema they will always be around its an experience that cannot be duplicated at home
2986,2981,Hamza Sayed,it can though newer tvs and sound systems will actually provide you better video and audio with most movies being in d these days id much rather invest in good d glasses for myself at home than wear cheap flimsy ones at theatres to me it feels like theatres are relevant because theyre a part of history and culture hence we still look forward to this experience the future generations might not feel so id say theatres are almost at the same level as newspapers where there is no real reason to have them but we have and use them anyway
2987,2982,Kathrine Ann Vlogs, sayed i have never met a single person in my life who actually uses a newspaper i dont even know where to get one
2988,2983,Hamza Sayed, ann vlogs yeah got phased out in the west still in circulation in asia though for no reason except its what people are used to i see theatres going the same way
2989,2984,Jonna King, sayed do you ever wanna just get out of the house tho  whats next will eatin restaurants be obsolete whats the point in going out to eat when you can eat at home  new generation is just a totally different mind set everything has to have a solid point otherwise its useless sometimes just looking forward to getting out of the house and doing stuff is its own point
2990,2985,Jonna King, sayed where i live we have newspaper stand everywhere  and about the theaters do young ppl not go on dates anymore or are dates obsolete as well 
2991,2986,Narja,idk abt that
2992,2987,Ratpatooti, king things change making fun of younger generations may be your way of coping but that effort would be better spent learning new things
2993,2988,Stevie J, ann vlogs newspapers arent gone theyre pretty easy to find actually i just turned  and we had subscriptions to  in my household growing up in la i loved reading them and i still do so i pick one up occasionally
2994,2989,Makaveli,streaming devices and gigantic expensive tvs with a dope sound bar or system in the privacy of your own home is way better and cheaper plus i get out of the house enough already  its way better whenever youre at some house party or little get together and you can legit turn on the living room television and watch what everyone else is watching in theaters

3010,3005,User Green,by the way pirates can cp film while it is in theateres so thats another reson
3011,3006,Dicky Ramadhan,watching in theater hits different due to its atmosphere and its not only about the sound or image quality the feeling of getting ready to go to theatre walking with tons of people with the exact same excitement in their brain waiting in the seat while you can just feel the hype from hundreds of people that can be felt in the entire room screaming and clapping together as soon the film start showing all the emotions the movie show ended where people in that room still talking bout the satisfaction they got and going home when ur brain is still popping that great memorybrbrthe feeling of watching endgame at theatre is what i described above ofc it will not be the same as in home no matter how great the equipment is the difference is like the excitement of watching a band concert in a venue rather compared to if the band comes for an exclusive performance at ur house
3012,3007,Tahir Khan,thats y v love torrents

3030,3025,Akhenaton Huerta,who else was screaming and clapping during infinity war and endgame absolutely legendary cant get those feelings at home
3031,3026,Amani Scott,its an odd thing being in a large dark room with strangers but its surreal knowing youre all there for the same interest to connect to the same characters and plots its really kind of a beautiful way to gather communities and be apart of the world i remember seeing marvel universe movies in theatre and actually conversing and connecting with the strangers around me with these phones and platforms we have those moments seem almost nonexistent and impossible to reach so yeah movie theatres are pretty important to me as i expect they are for a lot of people
3032,3027,Sameer Abdulqader,exactly i dont care how many sticky floors or people blocking the view i have to deal with knowing that you were able to witness an incredible moment on the big screen with a whole bunch of fellow fans makes it all worth it
3033,3028,jamie greenberg,seeing infinity war in a packed theater during the snapping scenes were probably something ill never forget

3046,3041,Al Bee,some kids may never know what its like to have a theater issue out free movie tickets to your parents after the power went out during a movie you wished you didnt have to go see anyways

3063,3058,Javier Isaac,as many the experience of watching a film in theaters will never be better than at home unless you have a theater in house of course
3064,3059,Lucien Desar,i love going to see movies in theaters however i hate high ticket prices boring highpriced concession stands cramped seats audience members talking during a film and seeing cell phones light up everywhere distracting me  i only go to alamo theaters for that reason now
3065,3060,Zenerax,i love my local cinemark and not just because my name happens to be marc a theater has a certain magic to it that watching at home just cant capture
3066,3061,mab,do we think theaters will ever expand whats shown on the big screen i can think of a few series premieresfinales i would love to see with a theater sound system succession for one
3067,3062,kidung malam,one of the malls in my city is dying  the tenants are not attractive at all and the visitors are low and then movie theatre came in and suddenly everything is changed number of visitors going up drastically and many new tenants came in movie theater saves that mall

3074,3069,FyberOptic,the biggest thing hurting theaters is the lack of movies that people care about going to see  when everything is a sequel reboot generic visual diarrhea etc then theres no sense of urgency to go see it  people will wait until they can stream it
3075,3070,caldore,quotgeneric visual diarrheaquot lol
3076,3071,Mike Whochee,exactly for example joker was a film i had to go see in a theatre as it was something fresh and just a really powerful film where its effect was enhanced by the theatre experience with loads of other films its just not worth it
3077,3072,Kitten Ritty,the last movie i saw in theatres was endgame and im glad cause i wouldnt want to pay for the movies that come out in theatres theyre so mediocre and cash grabs not to mention if i do like it i can watch it as much as i want on hbo max or paramount saves money on gas and food i dont have to wear a mask listen to whispers deal with ppl on their phones crying children or getting a seat i like  in tv plus sound bar is just as good imo but id prob only go to see any space movie in theatres like interstellar
3078,3073,The Norse Pioneer, whochee im glad you enjoyed joker but saying its fresh is disingenuous the film practically rips off taxi driver and king of comedy
3079,3074,Ben Arnold, norse pioneer and rips of decades of comic books and hero origin stories
3080,3075,Jonna King,id go just for the experience and getting out of the house  ive gone to see movies that dont really appeal to me just for that
3081,3076,FrostBite Pokin, norse pioneer thats pretty fresh considering those  films came out like  years ago

3085,3080,ummtoni,not to be dramatic but if movie theaters cease to exist there would be no reason to live at that point
3086,3081,Philip Williamson,to me this seems like the blockbusternetflix situation  movie theater chains shouldve caught up with the times and created competitive streaming services that could rival a hulu or whatever granted ill always love watching films in theaters times change we as humans grow to adapt they shouldve as well
3087,3082,Max Bickelhaup,date nights and teenagers anxious to get out of the house will never disappear theaters will always be in demand
3088,3083,Fahad QTR,i think the future is to compete on luxury experience
3089,3084,David Delaney,theres some sort of magic that happens with fully packed theaters watching a great movie the comradery is something that can never be replicated at home
3090,3085,All About Good news,i still prefer theater movies to watch movies because of experience and i do love when people gather and watch an anticipated movie of the year added also the smell of the popcorn in the theater with the total surround sounds while watching it boring to watch in streaming or tv
3091,3086,Mochizuki Tadayoshi,not a popular opinion but i am not really interested in going to a movie theater firstly it is because the price is higher secondly the food is limited and ofc theres variety of food but if i see consider spending that much i would only go to theaters once a year nevertheless pandemic changed my opinion on movies now i just watch whats available  best out of available  on streaming sites and im pretty sure that people are loving nf and prime video or else they wouldnt be running successfully but still majority of the people like to go theaters for change of atmosphere rather than focus on movie it is escaping the weekend after a whole week of workload and spending in a theater would cool them down
3092,3087,Sohail Parvez,both are here to stay in the long  i would want to casually re run an old movie or watch a sitcom with dinner but if i wanna see spiderman no way home i will definitely go to the movies with my friends and a bucket of popcorn no amount of streaming service or vr tech can replace movie going experience
3093,3088,ProGamerNG14,now with d no
3094,3089,Aska,nothing can replace watching a movie in a theater period

3098,3093,ola,i got a monthly pass to the cinema and honestly its been amazing this fall weve seen amazing and hyped movies and i appreciate them more when im not distracted by phone at home
3099,3094,The Shmekler,its hard for me to even imagine younger generations not understanding the distance of time we had to wait from theater to vhs releases it was always at least a year see it in theaters or wait  or  months for vhs or dvd to come out that was the standard now hbo max and theater releases on the same day i feel like i won the lotterybrbrspecifically kungpo enter the first because of distribution deals and legal delays i told so many friends that the movie was so good having seen it in theaters but when it was out of theaters they and myself had to wait over  years for its dvd release by then the hype had died down and everyone i had told about the film was uninterested at that point
3100,3095,Timotius Victor,im working in a movie theatre industry and  was really hard its honestly really scary for me and the quickest thing that comes to my mind is that people wont go back to movie theatre again since now watching movie via streaming is really accessible but after almost  years in this pandemic situation i honestly honestly finds it getting harder and harder to enjoy watching movie in my home for various reasons even though i just bought a new big screen tv to increase my movie watching experience at home but when i go back to cinema and watch james bond eternals shang chi i just couldnt imagine that i will enjoy them as much if i watch them at home in my new tv its a really different experience to watch movie in cinema and at home and now i realize that the cinema will still be around for a long time i think
3101,3096,BIASED,lol yeah theyre thats why every big movie becomes available on bluray in two months or less
3102,3097,I MAKE RANDOM VIDEOS,its hilarious that trolls world tour will go down in history as changing the game for film distribution forever

3104,3099,Windy 😁,i just watched arashis record of memories on cinema last month the first movie i watched in pandemic time cinemas give a different concert watching experience than watching it via vod or dvd this is a concert film footage and i only watched concerts from dvd or youtube before we can get some advantages from vod or dvd but the physical sensation nuance sound etc i got from watching films in cinema is irreplaceable its like i was brought into the films universe or more like i buy the experience on watching film on cinema
3105,3100,Batmann29,i really hope theaters stick around for another few decades sure its convenient to watch new movies at home but theaters are an entire experience and the same feeling cannot be duplicated at home unless youre a millionaire with a private home theater lol also i think theaters have gotten better throughout the years luxury recliners bigger screens d amp d options lets hope people will continue to support their local theaters in the coming years
3106,3101,Anonymous Caveman,i mean look at spider man cinemas have sold out there is also a huge fantastic experience of seeing a film in a cinema
3107,3102,Mahyar Mirrashed,imagine paying for an overpriced movie ticket with  profit popcorn and soda drink driving all the way out have trouble finding parking have people talk during your people or heaven forbid a child crying when you can pay  to do it at home with only the boys
3108,3103,Angad Singh,dont get popcorn then
3109,3104,Shivam Chakraborty,although i can vibe with the portability of streaming but i still think movie theatres are the way to watch a movie not only because of the great experience but also because its how the filmmaker has intended of us to watch the movie and they deserve it nobody can match that popcorn and cold atmosphere that the movie theatre creates
3110,3105,Jager0-0,whens  a look back coming out
3111,3106,macforme,well it looks like i am a contrarian i like watching a dvd at home  i dont have cable any more i like the convenience of stopping the movie for a phone call or a bathroom break i can go top up my beverage without missing a thing  also the prices of the matinees with large popcorn and a medium drink has hit the  mark i hate to think what it would cost on friday night for the same purchases so my days at a theater will be few and far between  as i like  bargains homemade popcorn takes better anyway
3112,3107,Everett Engbers,i remember when they were telling us that movie theatres were going to be a thing of the past when video tapes came out in the late s early s can anyone find a blockbuster store anymore
3113,3108,starterchannel,i saw last night in soho in theatres and it was just such an amazing and vibrant experience that i think watching it at home wouldnt have done the movie any justice
3114,3109,Mohamed Warsame,the movie industry isnt dead but as big tvs and home theaters increase it will definitely be a hybrid model moving forward studios will be more selective with which movies are theatrical releases versus direct to streaming the  markets will compliment each other
3115,3110,Claudia,in mexico way before the pandemic the movie roma was a simultaneous release in netflix and in theaters it was a success in both probably even more in theaters not quite sure why some people said because of the experience and quality of the cinema in mexico movie cinemas are a really fancy experience
3116,3111,Nick Barber,i dont even know what tower heist is and i wouldnt go to the theater to see it anyway
3117,3112,Veronica Jabilles,the cinema experience is way different from streaming online
3118,3113,Not Very Biased K Pop,amc to da moon
3119,3114,Steven Chow,i miss the video store experience
3120,3115,Alistair Kentucky-David,hopefully a shorter window will allow for obnoxious loudmouths to just stay at home and watch on tv leaving the theatres to a smaller but more passionate crowd of cinema lovers
3121,3116,Derik DL,kinda true if i watch a movie in the theatre its more likely i will watch it when it releases on platform multiple times i support movie theatre
3122,3117,Green Tea,for me watching a movie on theaters is a different experience the sound quality is great hearing everyones gasps laughter and cheers make the atmosphere different from watching it at home
3123,3118,martinithechobit,amc hold
3124,3119,jessedanielryder,id never go to a theatre again all my fam died from covid and theyre ripe of disease
3125,3120,Denay Santiago,id rather pay  for movie tickets and snacks idc 
3126,3121,AB F,theaters force you to watch the movie and if youre using your phone youre going to miss out somethings theres no pausing or rewinding movies at home are cool but theres so many distractions sometimes
3127,3122,Cat Face,the last movie i watched in a theatre was terminator salvation and before that it was the simpsons movie movies about superheroes just dont interest me brmaybe the new matrix movie and gostbusters would be worth going in to see for the event but ill wait for the reviews and probably just pick them up on dvd a month later
3128,3123,Gpaderx,one of the biggest factor that keeps theaters alive is social media there are so many spoilers to avoid spoilers the people decided to watch the movie on the first day or first week than waiting it in a dvd release or streaming company even they would shorten the window its unnecessary since the important part of the window is in the first week of the release
3129,3124,Eric Flores,the pandemic threatening amc bankruptcy madd me so happy
3130,3125,Trino Romo,i hate multiplexes but i would be willing to go to a movie palace or go to the new bev to see movies on actual film
3131,3126,sammhy,avatar  is the bubble for the movie theaters could possibly surpass avengers b mark again and studios should start by giving us quality instead of garbage films 
3132,3127,Los,i love the theatrical experience since the pandemic ive watched fewer movies than ever its impossible to replace the big screen and immersive audio of a theater not to mention watching a film in theaters is exactly how the filmmaker intendedbrbrhowever i havent been a fan of how the movie theater business whines whenever movie studios decide to change with the times audiences now vary in how they choose to enjoy their films streaming isnt going anywhere the theaters need to compete to keep the studios business instead of throwing tantrums when they dont get their way
3133,3128,Benjamin Whitley,im always reminded of the power and magic of the theater experience every time i see a trailer ive already seen at home on a giant screen and the movie always looks bigger more epic more exciting and more fun i really hope theaters survive
3134,3129,Ryan Pyle,thank you for calling it a vcr and not a vhs player i dont know why retroactively people think thats what they were called
3135,3130,Camilo Guzman,why theather chains dont get their own movie producing company
3136,3131,Jose Morales,meanwhile  will mark the st time in nearly  years that consumers will no longer be able to purchase an official hard copy format of a new film at all who would have thought even dvds would have a market value lifespan of  years yup the st commercial dvds officially hit american markets back in   years later sorry consumers either stream or dream if you had no idea how corporations truly felt about you oh well
3137,3132,Alex Cara,wrong warners hbo released their films on hbo max and in theaters simultaneously
3138,3133,inigojuancarlos,seeing films and any videos nowadays are pretty personalized now im sorry but streaming is the king now and it will be in the next hundred years unless you invented a new tech implanting films into our brains
3139,3134,Frank McGuire,nope they dead
3140,3135,*Camatzuma*,i think to stay alive more cinemas should play classic movies when the new releases arent exciting enough to watch in cinemas or a sequel is coming out people want to experience the same excitement they had before the age of streaming
3141,3136,Johnrex Bernal,the thing is that when you watched a movie from theatres that is a quotreal moviequot but when you watched it on most streaming platfrom quotyou think its a short film mostly on youtubequot the main difference of the both
3142,3137,Ray Jones,because you cant simply set up a  meter scene in the longe room with thx sound i go because of big screens and sounds
3143,3138,Senpaischick,people are saying dune and tennent needed to be experienced in theaters but i liked sitting in my house watching the movie on my own terms and not having to spend extra money on top of my current expenses they should do same day releases because a lot of people cant afford to take their big families to movies when ticket prices are  and concessions
3144,3139,Raheem D,i could be totally wrong as this is a complete generalisation from quora threads and youtube comments on videos similar to this that ive watched but it seems like its american audiences that despise cinemas more than anything the east seems to love cinemas whilst europe still enjoys them id guess its mostly about the expense in some american cinemas i do recall watching endgame in manhattan new york im from england and the tickets for my partner and i for imax came to around  madness whilst in the uk we tend to get them for half that
3145,3140,TheGreatBurg,youre correct here in the states a movie going experience is more of a luck of a draw sometimes it can be pleasant other times it cannot theaters have a way of ripping us off especially with ticket prices and snacks so much so we have to sneak in are own snacks
3146,3141,Kevin Kirkham,this is true i have a friend from spain where tickets for the opening of the new matrix movie are  at his local theater whereas theyre   here at mine we both live in similar sized cities
3147,3142,Michael Carbajal,i live in california and movie tickets for an imax screening are 
3148,3143,Christian Cárdenas,here in mxico we do still love cinemas they are quite cheap and with good quality
3149,3144,Abdullah Emad,i just bought my spiderman imax ticket for next week and it cost me exactly  here in egypt

3154,3149,Satyasiddha Mishra,i had watched d movies in india for around a dollar especially in the smaller cities the prices are lower and ott platforms are not that popular and going for movies with friends is totally a different experience
3155,3150,Mike Aya,im my country tickets are just  and we have bigger and better malls and multiplexes than the west and you can bring food from outside even so i only saw  movies in  a far cry from the s when i saw a movie every week
3156,3151,Random17Game,in my country we get cinema tickets at  portugal
3157,3152,Helvetica Calibri,well endgame was the movie event of the year and everything in new york is more expensive than it should be
3158,3153,Abhiraaj singh, for that in india  
3159,3154,Kacper Włoch,in poland its around  for any movie
3160,3155,Megan Dunklin,americans despise majority of things we are quite vocal yeah it took me living in new zealand to realise that we yanks do not appreciate the little things like going to a movie every week i always tell people if you want to save going to watch a film then go on a tuesday where tickets can be between  dollars it was a weekly event my roommates in new zealand use to do guess what what i got on the receiving endmore complaining
3161,3156,demon rat,in the uk its usually like  for me
3162,3157,jamie greenberg,yea the tickets here are super expesnive and so are the snacks thats why everyone sneaks them in the theaters here all the time
3163,3158,Christopher Liang,i get the amc stubs alist which is like  dollars for up to  movies per week
3164,3159,Daksh,i just went to spider man no way home in india in d for almost  dollars and the ticket for dx was  dollars
3165,3160,Bhargav patel,for me it was like  dollars for imax here in bangalore india
3166,3161,AC,yall will try to make anything americans dont like x people like going to the theatres here idk where you got that impression that we dont 
3167,3162,darexinfinity,true but sometimes i have to figure out how to spend time with my family without interacting with them theaters are the answer to that
3168,3163,Angie Roxy, carbajal that aint bad here in melbourne theyre c
3169,3164,Kibyfox,well thats imax theres a theater about  minutes away from where i live that costs  dollars for kids and  for adults im in the us

3177,3172,Yucel Faruk Sahan,another great content from vox thanks guys
3178,3173,Mich Washington,spidermanno way home will be the first billion dollar post pandemic theatrical release for the mcu yet
3179,3174,R H,because im still holding amc stocks
3180,3175,Thierry Parte,lets hope they keep it cinemas are also a fun thing to do with friends or family
3181,3176,Slug2ss,bro i prefer watching a movie release in a theater than at home driving there in the rain then opening the theaters door and boom its brightwarm crowded people laughing excitement is in the air you get in line to buy a pizza popcorn some nachos and the employees are happy you sit down wait a while the lights start to dim and everyone around you starts to cheer as you see a big marvel display

3185,3180,BadMoodBread,i definitely prefer a movie watching in the cinema over any other formbrthe experience to laugh cry and share emotions with the rest of the audience is something i want never t be missed
3186,3181,Ms. Pepperfield,theaters are bad
3187,3182,PhantomOfManyTopics,dune
3188,3183,Dead Man Drifting,cinemas the future is here old man
3189,3184,elendoy,as much as i like streaming content at home as soon as the theaters opened in my country and there were interesting movies to watch i was there between november  and today ive been to the movies at least  times and ill add  more before years end bri refuse to lose the movie going experience even if i have to wear a mask 
3190,3185,Wally & Tony,i refuse to go to a movie theater now theyre just not safe and are way too expensive
3191,3186,Julian Martinez,
3192,3187,Mariachee Bandidos,a href quotstronger than we thoughtquot brwhos quotwequot brdid people really believe the theaters were going anywherebror was that just a mediafabricated narrative
3193,3188,Nathan Ngumi,very insightful streaming does not have the shared experience that has always been one of the best features of cinema so movie theatres will be around for a long time
3194,3189,K1LLV,june to october three months
3195,3190,Gaurav Yadav,is this funded by amc etc who have seen their stock value dip  from its peek during the pandemic trying to convince ppl that cinematheater still a viable business
3196,3191,Bryan Garcia,movie theaters havent died because of three words no way home 
3197,3192,Super Song,as much as we hope to not happen move theatres will shrink in size and number prices might go higher and streaming might become even cheaper us the movielovers in the end are not the majority families will opt for home streaming for most casual films and maybe cinema theatres only as a mid to highend restaurant eatout kind of events sad but thats how it is until home setups can replicate the sound systems of a theatre too that is
3198,3193,Rajdeep Kashyap,i hope movie theatre stays around till movies stays around its a debate nonetheless watching something from your own comfort zone is the best thing but watching things where its meant to be is a whole another experience to add a pov to this topic from sports angle its like watching a match in tv and in stadium doesnt matter how many slow mo shots or replay you get to see in tv clearly the sense of high of watching a game in a stadium is unmatched
3199,3194,Izzy Woods,movie theaters are still in business because theyre dark and relaxing and were all strung out and anxious
3200,3195,Fortimus Prime,the theater experience is really something like no other experience i want theaters to stay around forever the last film i watched on a theater before the pandemic was sonic and i went back to theaters to watch encanto just when i entered the room to watch the film i got goosebumps and it is an overall special experience when you can laugh cry or relate to a character with a bunch of other strangers the theater is an experience like no other
3201,3196,seattlegrrlie,ive never liked going to the theater  it is a big reason why ive always had hbo  it was wonderful to watch dune same day at home with my glass of champagne   wish it would stay that way forever
3202,3197,KK M,it will be hard for theatres to business due to digital releases no one can deny the experience you have while watching the visually spectacular movies like lord of the rings avatar mad maxetc
3203,3198,Quang Anh Nguyễn,finally no more  fps animation
3204,3199,SkidMarks,making it easier and easier to pirate 
3205,3200,relentlessmadman,as new generations grow older the desire to go  will tends to diminish   and as the realization sets in that movies are just actors brplaying for pay and movies are not real life but rather a distraction from life  the theater experience will become less important the only thing saving theaters is gaint screens and body viberating explosions
3206,3201,misslittlesunshine,please dont take theaters away were already living in a lonely world
3207,3202,Fragment,as someone who watched sao progressive fan screening in the theatre i can confirm its not dead
3208,3203,Michael H,wonder if films are gonna become like video games with exclusivity rights for different platforms
3209,3204,Bianca Fernandez,some of my fondest movie memories take place in the theatre theatre hopping midnight releases and so on these are experiences that add that special zest to life when you look back something you can bond with others easily
3210,3205,лишенный & TMKOC,theatre sells food items  at remarkable high prices brits better to watch at home for me and enjoy
3211,3206,The Jedi Council,one answer exclusively in theaters
3212,3207,Ibadurrohman Musthofa,the most important of the movie theater is the immersive experience
3213,3208,Keith,most american movies arent worth seeing in a movie theater i imagine i will never see more than one movie per year in a theater from here on out after rise of skywalker i just dont feel like giving them money anymore
3214,3209,Anabelle Luvena,i love movies and as such cinemas arent going away for me at this stage my parents are still too scared to watch movies in cinemas we treat movies like a big family event and my parents often come along for the ride so were going to delay for a while until theyre comfortable enough with the situation in my country but i love how the dark room imax we almost exclusively watch imax ever since it was available my mom says anything else is too small and the surround sound puts me right inside a movie geez i forgot how it feels these days i barely watch movies at home other than the direct releases luca dune etc and some old ghibli films i need to catch up on since ive always seen them as passive forms of entertainment unless you can make it immersive  and movie theatres are definitely a way to make movies an immersive event theyre staying in my list and id hate to see them disappear

3217,3212,Chris Kelly,in december  the latest james bond film is still in cinemas at number  after many weeks but is now also on vod so given the choice in certain situations it isnt a zero sum game
3218,3213,Stein Gauslaa Strindhaug,cinemas used to be where you could see the full resolution physical film of the movie but now its just an oversized home cinema with digital projectors and way too loud surround sound brbrid rather wait to see it at home in the exact same image resolution but on a less flickery tv where i control the volume so i dont need to wear earplugs like i had to last time i saw a movie in cinema and i can pause if i need to and i dont get infected by others
3219,3214,Sérgio Nunes,always too loud for me some of us prefer not to start losing hearing at  years of age imagine if some stranger controlled your tv sound do you want someone dictating how you watch a paid movie session for  hours no thank you
3220,3215,Anthony Nelson,movie theaters will never entirely go away but theyll never be as significant as they were before the s imo ticket sales have been going down for decades for a variety of reasons expense shortened theatrical windows quality of movies home theaters etc and the quality of tv shows have caught up to that of hollywood blockbusters especially as far as narratives go big budget vfx driven movies will always look and sound better in a theater but dramas and comedies can easily be seen at home if you have a decent sized tv
3221,3216,Mulan 121,i want to see sing  with my kids last night and it was packed theres nothing like sitting in front of a huge screen with a killer stereo system surrounded by dozens of people all laughing at the same jokes and crying at the same sad moments were social creatures and this beats watching a movie on your own any daybrthats the same reason why concerts are better than live streams
3222,3217,Alparslan Korkmaz,nice video
3223,3218,Missy,i do hate how expensive movies are but due to the pandemic ive watched three movies on the big screen in the span of like two months which is a lot compared to prepandemic times and you just cant do what the cinema does like watching a movie at the cinema is just amazing and i am scared for the day that they go but i think that wont be until forever in the future
3224,3219,Felipe Ruiz,soon it will
3225,3220,Skylar,im surprised theaters are still alive you can wait a few weeks and watch the movie in your home theatre assuming you have one the experience in theatres has also trickled down and been duplicated for home users such as fullon moving seats dbox seats atmos etc
3226,3221,Июльское Утро,not a big fan of theaters but still its a great legacy a special way to spend your time with friends people already spend a lot of time at home on their own isolated big companies should let theaters live
3227,3222,jeannick guerin,interesting   pretty good piece  kudos
3228,3223,Dee M.,i just watched west side story with my youngest brother who happens to be on the spectrum and the feeling that i got seeing him burst into applause after the america number priceless cinema is so uniquely magical and i wish a long life for it

3233,3228,Tyler Durden,i think its like books vs ebooks the latter should logically replace the former but theres something about flipping the pages feeling in on your fingertips and the smell of the pages
3234,3229,Melissa0774,i think the future of theaters is going to be stuff like imax and d and maybe even socalled smell o vision and stuff like that
3235,3230,LeaveMeAlone,there are just some movies u have to see in theaters to get the full experience
3236,3231,Hazey Cazey Tv,vox forgot to mention the impact same day streaming had on piracy
3237,3232,ASTN,i like going to the theater its good to get out of the house but on the other hand watching it at home means i can order whatever food i want to eat with the movie

3240,3235,M L,um maybe this is a generational thing gen z but i would rather watch the movie at my house with my friends and further the discussion about the movie online with other movies lovers of the film its just better that you get to actually talk about the movie and have discussions right after with a lot of people then just returning home and talking about it with the few you chose to invite and you dont have to be among a random crowd of people you dont actually get to talk with

3253,3248,Ularg,real fun to see how movie studios and theaters got split because it was unethical to own both but yet movie studios owning the streaming services is somehow okay
3254,3249,Miguel CPR,dune in imax is the reason

3271,3266,Trung Nguyen,spiderman is coming and my city has yet to greenlit cinema reopening sigh
3272,3267,Fika Aulia,because i live in small city so the option to hangout with my friends is limited cinema is the best choice
3273,3268,RoboticDragon,i am another huge movie theatre fan i do not ever want to see theatres go away i love them
3274,3269,meow,a showcase cinemas near me that i have so many memories of is gone replaced by an amazon warehouse
3275,3270,A,i dont think i wouldve enjoyed a movie like eternals as much at home as i did in theaters watching it in imax was beyond amazing
3276,3271,Faith Dionne,i still enjoy the movie theater surround sound and the perfect reclining seat will always beat my inch tv and couch
3277,3272,E. Camilo,theatres is dead business model if you are investing in it you are going to have a bad time the new generation will stream everything universal is years ahead of the other studios
3278,3273,Felipe M,i love movie theaters the ritual and excitement of going to the movies inviting friends buying popcorn and candy then rushing to the screening room because its about to start id never give up that for streaming services
3279,3274,Arash Bal,just wait for vr to take over 
3280,3275,ȘoimulX,i think i will go more often to the cinema
3281,3276,wenwei su,for certain movies like scifi cinemas and especially imax are the only way to enjoy the movies even for rom coms and comedies it is more enjoyable to watch them with others in a cinema setting
3282,3277,John Doe,theaters can definitely survive the pandemic with apes money
3283,3278,Ranjit Singh,some movies are just made to be seen on the big screen i refused to watch dune on streaming it was one of the best theater experiences ever
3284,3279,Jake Greene,imagine seeing endgame infinity war or no way home for the first time on your television at home no hype
3285,3280,Jennifer Sun,going to the movies is a cheap date
3286,3281,アリア,sure i loved going to the theaters to experience them in imax to get that surround sound and excitement of a midnight showing but i wont miss going back to screaming kids people who shine their phones during the movie or just being around other people during a pandemic in general at least i dont have to worry if i miss something at home than in a movie theater
3287,3282,Debjit Ghosh,bruh i still remember the avengers endgame captain america holding thors hammer moment in theatres it was one of the best moments i have experienced in theatres vod can never replicate that stat
3288,3283,Francois Beavertree,theaters
3289,3284,scanman,first video that ive watched by vox that i dont think is wellopinionated or researched theatres seem to me to be a middle man that was necessary in the past and is becoming less by the year they now are for almost everyone obsolete for all nonstage or localindie productions and should be treated as efficient and greedy  like service fees on a receipt etc
3290,3285,theghostintheruins,i doubt ill ever go to the cinema again to be honest
3291,3286,Day,im not parent not sure ill ever be bri think we can all admit parent or not if i had to choose to take my toddler to a movie theater  and not have them enjoy it have to hear other peoples kids cry durning the movie consent potty breaks falling asleep because they missed nap time and the expensive snacksdrinks youll know your kids want i would feel like i wasted my moneybr i would rather choose to stream the movie at home vs then taking a small fussy human to a crowed movie theater brbrit make sense why trolls did so well on demand its like the answer to every parents worse nightmare taking a toddler or young kid to a movie theater now can be completely avoid and besides that you know your kid is going to want to watch it multiple times in a row if they enjoy the movie so renting it on stream is huge money saver vs seeing it theater multiple times brplus streaming on demand does make going to the movies more of a special treat vs feeling like you have to go to see that movie you been waiting for a year for
3292,3287,sel18,i dont think studios quotneedquot theaters there is a benefit both economical and sociological to theater releases as mentioned in the video going to a theater is an event however in a world where one cam have that shared moviewatching experience without being in the same room or even the same state that event can be had in different ways yes physical presence and proximity are still valuable but for a great many people that is becoming a secondary factor given the novel ways in which a shared experience can be had today i envision theaters  being around for some time but i imagine people will choose to go for very specific movies or moments opting to enjoy movies at home more often
3293,3288,Amelia H,i will rarely watch a movie in theaters because im frugal and because at home you can pause a movie and because i dont care if i see a movie as soon as it comes out brbri enjoy going to the movie theater its a fun outing with family so i hope theaters can stay around
3294,3289,Amelia H,id love to see rattatouille in theaters or another of my favorite movies
3295,3290,Rachel Harris,if im going to spend  i would rather do it in person and at a theater i would spend about  on the ticket and another  on snacks im not going to spend that to rent a movie for a short window of time online
3296,3291,thirtycats,maybe theaters should do what other companies do make their own content  and maks it that the content can be seen only at their theaters never released online  they could release and rereleasethey could also have special showings for communities and peoole who might find typical theater experiences challenging
3297,3292,Sef,amc
3298,3293,Oklomsy,i think dvds and cds are better than both because you actually own the movie and can see it even when you dont have internet or when the theater is closed and you lend it to a friend you can do whatever you want with your copy
3299,3294,Star Edwards,watched dune on hbo max when it came out went to see it again the next day in imax
3300,3295,Micah Visser,pirating would stop theaters in their tracks if it got more popular
3301,3296,A2Z2REAL 7557,just a matter of time and those names will be public with epstn island and the sick truth who was involved they are all guilty  not up to us to judgemaby arrange the meeting  evil will thrive if good man stand by and do nothing
3302,3297,Jonatrus,i honestly would not mind if cinemas went away everything is expensive and you can get the same experience at home without dealing with loud people in the cinema its just marketing and nostalgia that makes people want cinemas to stick around
3303,3298,Helgali,i rather watch it at home i control the volume subtitles bathroom breaks snacks time i can talk or not hear others talking im not in a closed space with people sneezingcaughing with cellphones ringing sticking floors trash and in the us mass shootings
3304,3299,J T,was lucky enough to have a drive in open during the beginning of the pandemic
3305,3300,manish taker,theatres are amazing they are going to stay here
3306,3301,Tom G.,this will just speed up the release of pirated copies online
3307,3302,Earl john Quita,ads in torrents
3308,3303,hkhtheoriginal,i can watch any movie i want without paying
3309,3304,Jonas Graham,i think some people are willing to pay more to see a movie or tv show before everyone else  and if studios just released movies onto their regular streaming platforms like netflix or disney they wouldnt get that much marginal revenue as people already subscribed to the service would get it for freebrbri propose streaming services offer a quotpremierequot option for many big movies and tv shows where customers can pay extra to see the movie or show now  every other subscriber will be able to see it too  in a few months  but if you wanna see it now you can pay extra
3310,3305,Will Holz,incentivizing people to go to crowded theaters during a pandemic is abhorrent
3311,3306,Iskra,big win for piracy
3312,3307,Joe Joey,case in point for me is eternals everyone has mixed reviews about the movie so i skipped the theatrical release first time for an mcu movie for me and watch it in january on disney plus
3313,3308,Stan Lee,i just want to watch movies dont care where i watch it from
3314,3309,Mo Bk,no mention of directors opinion
3315,3310,Verretta,quotyetquot
3316,3311,RS 1990,movie theaters are called cinemas in other countries like australia new zealand and the united kingdom 
3317,3312,Gemini Jones,i got to see candyman  in theaters the first film i got to see in movie theaters before the pandemic when it comes to an enjoying a film to the max movie theaters is still the best way to go
3318,3313,Ian Lister,are not cinemas in the quotdeath by a thousand cutsquot phase now for every weekend you binge something on disney its  a weekend you dont go to a cinema for every movie that you skip the cinema for because its gonna be on disney in what seems like only a few weeks now its one less ticket sold if you are not sure about a movie and dont go first weekend i would speculate you end up waiting for it to come to a streamer rather than going to a cinema two or three weeks in
3319,3314,Jose Nell Andrew Tumulak,dope
3320,3315,John Chevski,nothing like go to the mall on weekend to see a good movie on theater and then have a good meal at the restaurant after that been doing it since the s at least once a month
3321,3316,Kevin Luo,the movie theaters have huge screensthat create a sense of awe you simply cant fit in your house
3322,3317,My L I E G E,well i for one am surprised and pleased that the future will have streaming and theatrical releases simultaneously i can avoid american audiences that scream too loud in the theaters and the danger of the pandemic in public
3323,3318,Aaron Bell,i actually enjoy movies at the theater
3324,3319,Aj Welgemoed,its not dead for me just bought tickets to go see quotspiderman no way homequot on the th
3325,3320,Luz y Sonido Sound Waves,whatever new way of watching a movie it will never compare to watching it in a movie theater the experience of something magical is there in a theater
3326,3321,Nikki Tradzine,in france i have a cinema card that costs me about  per month for unlimited movie access with the price of a single ticket i only need to go twice per month to break even i go more often because i love cinema outings i dont know whether this option exists in the us but it may help to preserve the cinema experience
3327,3322,Caio,when i went to see dune on opening week i was shocked at how empty the theatre wasbrits an unsustainable business model nowadays
3328,3323,ALTAIR,it will be dead in  years 
3329,3324,Tanay Albuquerque,with the rise of netflix originals more and more movies will shift to exclusively streaming
3330,3325,M. H.,theyll never be
3331,3326,Shane Suen,watching movies at home is just not the same as watching them in theater i usually watch some  movies i dont really care for at home and save the juicy ones for theater 
3332,3327,mahesh s,theatres allow me to experience a movie with a crowd imagine watching the matrix in a theatre with others vs at home all by yourself or with familyfriends that emotion is hard to replicate by a streaming platformbrbrsame goes to watching sports in the stadium on tv you get instant replays and slow motion shots etc in the stadium you dont get that however people still love to watch sporting events at the stadium just to experience it with a large crowdbrbrtheres just something about being in a large social group to experience a movie or a f race or a football match that makes it more exciting
3333,3328,Aman Rahman,how is waiting for spiderman to hit theatres
3334,3329,Boxy,the only thing that vod cant do is the experience in theaters
3335,3330,cold grandpa,solution movie theaters start playing movies made by smaller companys like sundance kinda deal idk
3336,3331,Jivin Thomas,i dont care what others think but i honestly prefer watching a cinema in my tv or mobile rather than going to a theatre
3337,3332,Alexander G,i hate watching movies at the theaters ive stopped entirely now and rather wait to see it at home
3338,3333,Jonathan Pinzon,because i love cinema
3339,3334,Nick Lavigne CVC,i will always go
3340,3335,KimchiFYeah,lol good luck if it goes pure streaming no more big blockbuster movies with big budgets none of those digital releases will ever hit the sales that the theatrical releases brought you cant tell me avengers will hit b in tickets on streaming platforms
3341,3336,Wicked Hero,arrrrr
3342,3337,Coastal Giraffe,i recently read somewhere that art is a onesided conversation with the unobservedquot so an art like filmmaking works best for some stories that need to  be told in an unfiltered manner without censorship this aspect is currently working in favor for online streaming platforms as films that are usually exclusively released in theatres go through a rigorous prescreened censorship in some countries compared to streaming platforms this ends up  hindering the craft of filmmaking and directors vision as well
3343,3338,Saverio Alberini,when movie theaters will close cinema will be dead
3344,3339,Sagar Nandi,summary of this video piracy
3345,3340,King SB,studios vs theatres
3346,3341,Nicholas George,because it gives us something to do and a reason to go out of the house is why
3347,3342,Karthik Selva,if theatres cant survive all mass gathering events wont the way we socialize will be changed more of a downhill
3348,3343,Deepak Sanaka,im a software engineer at a company called comscore inc im part of a team  where we work on products that collect and report box office data from almost every theater in the world to the studios  were the only company to do it in the past  years there have been significant changes made to the theater ecosystem i had the opportunity to experience and implement some of them theaters are here to stay
3349,3344,Thryx20,i dont mind them but man are they expensive i can buy a dvd of the movie for cheaper
3350,3345,Mayank Khatri,thats why i watch only prated
3351,3346,jay,i mean if i wanna watch movies with friends ill go watch it irl but if its not available ill just watch the pirated version and stream on discord
3352,3347,Havvlen Star,dunno  i used to go to lord of movies on theaters but just before covid hit i was already taking a break and having been back since almost  years since  i though about going another day  but i keep making excuses not to go i guess i just dont feel the need any longer 
3353,3348,Jelly Fish,eventually smaller theaters will be the norm especially as disposable income disparity increases
3354,3349,Milos Krstic,the day movie theaters are dead im leaving this planet
3355,3350,Dovyeon,i stopped going to the theater because i only had to wait a few months and now i can wait to see the movie in bad quality as soon as its in theaters and only wait for a few months for it to be in good quality
3356,3351,Hibban Abdullah,well the experience watching movie in theater is really good with added kids noise  say no one
3357,3352,Avith Ortega,people have to choose between getting a home theater entryticket for  or investing  in audio and video equipment that replaces the same quality and resolution of the first and also they need to calibrate the audio the video the roombrmost people dont have money for the last option so home theaters are still necessary
3358,3353,Koshie,the convenience of streaming movies in the comfort of my own home being able to pause for a break not having to pay a small fortune for popcorn why would anyone ever step food in a theatre theatres died the day streaming went mainstream rip welcome to the age of on demand
3359,3354,Chum Krimson,quotbeing able to pause of a breakquot is exactly the problem nothing breaks the immersive experience like pausing going on your phone or doing anything that breaks the cinematic experience
3360,3355,Koshie, krimson ok boomer
3361,3356,Arnab Mukherjee, krimson i have a dedicated home theater system nothing beats the quality of that than going to a cinema where children are crying sticky seats and frigging heads popping out of no where mald cope and seethe
3362,3357,Chum Krimson,arnab mukherjee your living room has  of the atmosphere that makes cinemas a great experience ive never seen a baby crying in a theater or any baby actually maybe you should go to a better theater or watch better movies but even then going to nonluxury or older theaters are still better than watching movies in your living room
3363,3358,JessieJamesPlays,i still like the deafening sounds that you hear in theaters vs streaming
3364,3359,Boot Scootin Lam,movie theaters will go extinct just bring back drive in movie theaters in partnership with netflix and other companies for covidapproved
3365,3360,fireaza,another aspect to consider is picture quality at the dawn of home video vhs laserdisc and dvd were only around p well below the k or so that movies in theatre were shown at even with the introduction of bluray movies on home video were still half the quality of what you could see at the cinemas if you wanted a highquality picture you had to go to the cinemas now k tvs are common and we can watch movies at k on uhd bluray or streaming services and in hdr to boot meanwhile a lot of movies at the cinema are still only shown at k the number of advantages cinemas have over home video is rapidly shrinking
3366,3361,Stein Gauslaa Strindhaug,it used to be film which doesnt have pixels only grain so it was practically as high resolution as possible but then they downgraded to digital projectors with limited pixel resolution just like modern television thus removing the unique advantage cinema had over tv
3367,3362,Veronica Gorosito,so simple as acoustics and surround systems and to meet more people maybe your next partnerbrbrmany things like going to a music festival it has no comparison
3368,3363,Paul Nguyen,amc to the moon
3369,3364,Dezero 10,never thought a trolls movie would be this historical btw it has kpop in itrv so good
3370,3365,KRYPTOS ROCK is a DJ too,never forget trolls world tour destroyed cinema
3371,3366,C K,ott
3372,3367,Josh Nixon,id rather watch from home except for a select few movies
3373,3368,Heeehaaw,im afraid smaller theatrical runs will make multiplex companies to make the screen smaller and increase the number of halls so that they can show more shows at the same time that will really ruin the experience moreover food and beverages will only get more expensive
3374,3369,nxcholas travels,buy amc thank me later
3375,3370,A Dheeraj ce18b017,in india movie theatres are an integral part of the culture especially for telugu tamil and hindi audience no festival vacation is complete without a movie at the theatre for millions
3376,3371,RedAmalgam,as long as they stay around ill always support theatres
3377,3372,LeakyPirate,i miss going to the theatre since the pandemic the smell of crusty popcorn and the over priced snacks
3378,3373,Alvin Lee,what happened to scarlett johanssons case for black widow
3379,3374,Brian Lalonde,so were just going to blindly accept the industry assertion that theatrical release windows workbrbrdespite the argument they themselves make that there is a distinct qualitative difference between a theater and streaming well just accept that the viewing public will judge them as roughly equivalent unless corraled into the correct behaviorbrbrid assert that streaming revenue is additive to not subtractive from theater revenue regardless of timing id imagine warners  financials could bear this out do you have compelling evidence to the contrary
3380,3375,Ferlan Lebrado,nothing will ever defeat the experience on the big screen unless people build movie theaters at home lol
3381,3376,Arthur John Ashley Bernabe,in anime you have to wait for  frickin years for a dvd version of a anime movie
3382,3377,Ernest Bywater,if all the films go to theaters and other releases on the same day youll see a significant drop in theater attendance and the theaters closing down which will affect the film publicity while the delay between theater and streaming release exists there will be people who want to be able to says quoti saw the film on the first day or week the film was in the theatersquot but should that ability vanish due to same day streaming then those people stop attending theaters attendance drops too far and the theater owners can make more money selling the theater for offices or condos
3383,3378,Manuel Hanko,i sometimes go to theatres to support a movie or a genre that i like and want more to be made of
3384,3379,AussieTV,i last went to a cinema in  id rather watch it at home even better now with k screen  it just looks like a theatre screen
3385,3380,Thanh Dinh,only in theaters sure
3386,3381,ole reliable,amc to the moon
3387,3382,Srcuso,streaming is killing the quality film industry
3388,3383,Sarwar Azad,theatres are not going anywhere soon
3389,3384,"love, sam",ott
3390,3385,GGItzfunny,theater
3391,3386,Ankur Mahajan,change is the only constant theaters going to stay
3392,3387,Max B,i definitely dont miss people talking loudly and munching on popcorn with their screaming babies while watching movies oh and nyc movie ticket prices were becoming outrageous  for imax  regular movies im so happy theaters are going to be gone eventually
3393,3388,Marc o,screaming babies thats unlucky
3394,3389,Tushna Mistry,would have also liked if you included more on the layer about streaming services netflix prime etc becoming huge studios in their own right and the complexity that adds to the equation brbrthere will also be certain kinds of movies that are always better watched in theatres vs on smaller personal  home devices
3395,3390,Mikayla Williams,theaters wont go away few people yes but the movie going experience is so important i was one of those kids watching toy story in the theaters nothing will compete with that i see the benefit of ondemand but i prefer to see the movie in the theater dune was a huuuge example of that the experience was amazing
3396,3391,Mike Multo,watching movie on a theather is still a good choice because theathers can bring a complete package of viewing atmosphere especially with the audio technology not all can afford to buy a big k tv with a numerous speakers standing and crawling on their living rooms except for those who will just watch them via portable device with a plain headphones
3397,3392,Patrick,this video hasnt explain a single thing to me why they manage to survive during these  year of pandemic how did they survive those earlier months of having no revenue
3398,3393,bilandi,i work at a mall theater and i think watching movies in that way is still really fun every marvel movie we screened had huge crowds on the weekend seeing dune in imax was something else matrix resurrections and across the spiderverse are the ones im the most exicted for definetly getting into early screenings for those
3399,3394,MR K,theater should bring dx experience to survive bring something that we cant get from our living room
3400,3395,Lopsided32, question i went back to watch some of yalls older videos like quotwhy are we so lonelyquot and i got me thinking about something my brother said quotyou have to teach your brain to listen better by listing to things at a lower volumequot so i was wondering if that could really work or just something he made up your videos are awesome  keep up the good work
3401,3396,Em El,i prefer watching big movies in a theater its still a unique experience
3402,3397,Ian Zainea,love the cinema streaming is like meh its not the same experience at all even if you have a dope home theater set up its still merely an imitation of the a proper cinema
3403,3398,John Samuel,movie theaters wont go away  but we should be able to watch movie on demand through streaming services at release day the theatrical window should be stopped
3404,3399,MimiRox13,ive never been a huge fan of converting movie releases to steaming what i think a lot of people dont understand about film is that it is not cheap there are so many complaints about remakes and franchises but thats the only way studios iknowi theyre going to recoup their budget if people want bgoodb quality films then theyre going to need to accept that majority streaming is going to dampen the variety of quality films we get it already has i personally think going back to the model ofbrtheater only release first weekbron demand one time viewing after theatrical releasebrwait  months then buy the dvdbluraydigital copybris better because then the casual movie goers who prioritizes control of the movie over theatrical experience can still see it at home but not hurt salesgt creating opportunities for a variety of iqualityi films brcomparing the us film industry from past decades to now supports this bralso you cant use the quality of shows or limited series as an argument because they require completely different things
3405,3400,naojp1,culture of going to the movie theater wont dissappear we cant replace the place with netflix and amazon
3406,3401,a random handsome man,to be honest i watch all my movies online for free
3407,3402,SausageWizard69,i dont wanna live in a world that doesnt have going to the movies
3408,3403,Mark Hancock,a couple of other pointsbr for the black widow release scarlet j argued that disneys decision to do simultaneous release had cost her money because she got a percentage of theater sales but not streaming sales  is is not only theaters that are impacted by these decisionsbr many awards amp records are structured around box office numbersbr not too long ago quotmade for tvquot meant quotnot worth showing in a theaterquot  this is certainly not the case any more as there are some movies and shows exceed what had been possible to do in theaters
3409,3404,LOTUSELISE340R,she did a heck of a lot more than argueshe filed a lawsuit and rightfully won a settlement terrible pr move by disney to try and bilk an alister
3410,3405,Oh_knee,thank you for mentioning that you would think they would do all the research
3411,3406,Jaime Rudio,scarlet j isnt hurting for money dude lol
3412,3407,Bruce Lee, she didnt do anything the lawfirm shes attached to did the filings
3413,3408,Mark Hancock, rudio disney isnt hurting either
3414,3409,hernández, rudio fr 
3415,3410,Jiji, rudio neither are the studios that employ her
3416,3411,CSGO ARK, employedbrpast tensebrshed not get a disney job again for sure
3417,3412,Aya Baheera, ark apparently they worked things out shes slated to produce upcoming disney projects
3418,3413,Walley,not only theatres impacted but rich celebrities too and the only losers are the customers who get their option limited so they can milk as much money as they can
3419,3414,Razear,theres always going to be a market for people that want to watch a film in theaters instead of at home but as the consumer tech advances well be getting closer and closer to mirroring the experience i wouldnt be surprised if we see theaters going the blockbuster route in the next  years
3420,3415,serenediipity,me who just turned in a research essay on a similar topic  weeks ago and missed out on being able to cite this video
3421,3416,rssvzn,when i watch movies at home there are too many distractions and interruptions but if i go to the theatre then i can watch the whole movie continuously with only one well timed breakbrbesides the big screen and the dark room with no sounds except the movie and maybe the audience thats a real experience brif i cant afford the first weekend then ill wait a couple weeks but i really want to watch it on the big screen and i really hate it when i miss out a good movie due to things like exams or work or something its just not the same on tv or a laptop or something
3422,3417,Stein Gauslaa Strindhaug,youre aware that you can turn off the lights and your phone at home as well
3423,3418,gtd,if a party of  go to see a movie in the theaters thatss  tickets sales split in two ways  but if a party of  decide to stay at home that would be a quotticket salequot of one that quotservesquot  people  and dont forget its usually vod is cheaper than the price of a ticket  on the other hand how many people go in a group larger than  or  to the theaters  and how many vod events have more than one person  brbrtheres probably a fairly involved equation that studios use to determine the length of exclusivity with theaters
3424,3419,BEST LIVE,omg exactly what i neededapply for loans up to  over the phone fast convenient confidential and secure  call       
3425,3420,Fabian Armilla,took my nephews to the movie theaters this past weekend the look on their faces when the film came on that big silver screen was priceless for me going to the movie theaters is an irreplaceable experience got tickets for spiderman next week cant wait

3436,3431,Villiam Stranf, theater gives good experience
3437,3432,Elevatorman 546,i go to movie theaters for the better sound experience i have a sound bar with dts virtualx but height virtualization and virtual surround sound can never be as good as movie theater surround for a regular screening in our local cinemark it is something like  or  sound for  cinemark xd we have dolby atmos ceiling speakers and  sound with two height layers my sound bar is just  with dtsx height virtualization so that is my reason for going to theaters
3438,3433,David Bambino,ott
3439,3434,Zubair Shah,if you have an oled tv watching a movie at cinemas is a massive downgrade which i am not people would want to pay for only a matter of time before oled become cheap now
3440,3435,Isho GT,i cant imagine not watching interstellar in the cinema same goes for dunkirk completely different experience than watching it at home

3443,3438,Amal Faizal,theatre 
3444,3439,Chad Smith,it should be noted that this is a very us experiencebrhere in australia trolls world tour did not hit vod with its release being delayed by months to aim for when cinemas were reopening the studios got away with what they could in different regionsbrsince then weve seen more bigger budget movies hit vod in day  but still not nearly as many as the us
3445,3440,Abdullah Emad,it makes sense considering the us is one if not the biggest market for cinema entertainment
3446,3441,59 Master,we all know why were here to see spiderman no way home
3447,3442,Bumblebee,honestly theater will be history soon no longer practical plus coronavirus made it worsein  years you will only go there just for fun

3449,3444,"OLIDO, JOSEPH D.",why vox arent dead yet
3450,3445,ariel pazmino,yall disagreeing cuz the pandemic tbh thats the only reason before that everyone was going to the movies and stuff and a movie theater no matter how big its the tv u have at home it aint the same
3451,3446,John C,i will say this i love movie theaters but they are too expensive however i refuse to pay movie theater pricing for streaming in the end ill go to a theater or ill just out right pirate the movie
3452,3447,POLM PHOTO,movies might not be dead but i dont want the reason to be because i went to one in a pandemic
3453,3448,Jo Mo,some times a preview on disc can promote theatre viewing
3454,3449,Jerry Jazzbo,end the mask mandates and you will have people returning to the theatres simple as that dont pretend otherwise
3455,3450,Bunny,studios need to start making it easier for theaters to show movies from their back catalogs having properties basically just sit around doesnt do anyone any favors especially now when basically only cinephiles are buying dvds and blurays with digital projection they could very easily let theaters show practically anything they wanted they dont have to send physical prints i dont understand why there isnt a push for this it seems mutually beneficial for everyone why do studios care if theyre making money on trolls world tour breakfast at tiffanys the wizard of oz or clueless so long as theyre making money
3456,3451,A C,itd likely be unprofitable for the theatres since studios necessarily charge exorbitant prices even on backcatalogues otherwise their perceived value drops and that cost combined with unfilled seats would just end up draining theatres pockets to make studios even richer
3457,3452,ultraali453,i agree they could start asking people to vote for the movie theyd want to see and decide based on that imagine halloween being full of themed movies for a month again voted for by the people
3458,3453,US,as a kid i thought only in theaters meant that they were never showing the movie again after that
3459,3454,US,only in theatersbrand yet so many of us waits till theyre streaming a few weeks later
3460,3455,Echa,since the theatres are quite luxurious and cheap here in indonesia i def opt for going to the cinema the first couple of days the films been released very entertaining and a fun experience for me
3461,3456,Vincero Alpha,to be fair trolls  didnt have much in the way of competition and people wanted something new
3462,3457,David Zavala,i like the theater experience plus being with fans all around it fun like when i watched dragon ball super broly and end game but what i do want is all movies be realease worldwide on the same day and on streaming within  days
3463,3458,Weicong Zhang,vr is taking over movie theater
3464,3459,jakmanxyom,i wonder if there are local sociocultural factors that come into play over preferring to watch in cinemas as soon as they can in prepandemic malaysia going to cinemas were still seen as a quotgrand daynight eventquot including eating out at the best restaurants one can afford
3465,3460,Lisa Seabrook,be the news
3466,3461,Lisa Seabrook,if i wanted to know about theatres i can do that research myself i subscribe to you to because you talk about things like environmental change and politics
3467,3462,Lisa Seabrook,be a news channel please
3468,3463,Lisa Seabrook,vox talk about serious problems please i like your research team but i think theyre wasting their energy talking about movie theatres
3469,3464,HoennMaster,while i am super glad that the theatrical windows of movies have shrunken i hope theaters can thrive againi want to see the movie on the big screen and have that experience but also not have to wait forever to buy it if i want just in the last month i was able to see a movie in theaters and then but it on bluray less than two months later that is fantastic
3470,3465,Dan Harris,i dont like going to the theaters they are so loud that i sometimes get noiseinduced hearing loss once in a while i rather watch a movie in a controlled environment where i can keep the volume lower
3471,3466,XgamerdaveX,i much prefer watching a movie at home
3472,3467,Miguel gallardo,big films the really big ones like mcu bond star wars amp big budget action flicks will not be possible without theaters these films cost  million plus and at least another  million to market not to mention miscellaneous expenses you talking about break even points  to  million you cant make that kind of money without a theater netflix spends hundreds of millions on movies but its not sustainable they dont make a profit because they spend it all on new content simple math tells us the for a  million film they would need  million new subscribers to pay for it universal will lose money
3473,3468,Daniel Friesen,quotthanks to a supreme court case from the s movie studios and theater owners in the us are separate entitiesquotbrbrand now weve come full circle with nearly every streaming service also being a movie studio
3474,3469,Justa Youtuber,streaming copyrighted movies is not illegal  only uploads and redistributing them torents pp  i havent paid to see a movie in decades
3475,3470,zedeighty,i dont want to live in a world without movie theaters it will always be the best way to watch a movie
3476,3471,Justa Youtuber,people can try to support this like they did film camerastheyre going byebye  old way of doing things  like arcades
3477,3472,Justa Youtuber,ive seen one movie in a theater in the last  years  had free tickets theaters are like arcades photo booths or jazz clubs
3478,3473,KiNGstarNoah,arcades are a bad example since there are arcades in literally almost every city and multiple in big cities and this is excluding casinos me as teenager has never met someone who hasnt been to a place like dave amp busters at least once
3479,3474,Sadim Hall,they should repeal that law and disney should buy amc
3480,3475,Yawsea,this thing is seriously making me want to see encanto in theaters instead of pir steaming it
3481,3476,Derek Caan,i think watching a movie in the theater is more than just a movie itself you get so much more out of that event so i dont think theaters are going away necessarily at least with this generation of viewers maybe another  odd years of shifting habits of consumers towards more digital maybe
3482,3477,LackOfABetterWord,trolls world tour nah
3483,3478,declan lyons,you made the theatrical window smaller for toy story  on the timeline whys that
3484,3479,Icarus,as someone who has invested money into a theatre room setup i couldnt care less about movie theatres anymore the audio and vidsual quality of my theatre room so far beyond what my local movie theatre and closest amc has
3485,3480,KittySnicker,i love that going to the theater is an occasion i dont want to always be cooped up at home
3486,3481,D,imagine being able to watch squid game money heist or got at the cinemas
3487,3482,Corgimations,i only go since th popcorn is so good there and not as good at home

3490,3485,-stephen-,hopefully movie theaters dont turn into malls one of the movie theater i go to is still open but right next to it is a dead mall
3491,3486,Sam Clay,theres just something great about seeing it in theatres
3492,3487,SAHM,can you guys talk about how all movies are a franchise now its all sequels prequels reboots series or the story is pretty much similar to another one very few movies with original novel stories
3493,3488,oaktree_,we all still associate a nontheatrical release as quotdirect to videoquot it decreases the films perceived quality also nothing can replicate the experience of watching a movie in theatres  its a social experience a shared experience theres an quoteventnessquot to it you cant do that at home by definition
3494,3489,Eman Tabrizi,i see absolutely no reason to ever go back to a movie theater  may they rip
3495,3490,Brad Colby,i will always go see movies in theaters theres nothing like it  
3496,3491,Saya's simp who is stuck in a rabbit hole,ever since movie theatres reopened most of the time when i went there i was the only person in the audience and other times i was one of the few people in the audience
3497,3492,armanke13,from outside us global movie market i assume vod and streaming are easier to rip bootlegged that leads to significant number of pirated videos there
3498,3493,Brian Rowe,had to see dune in the theater it was amazing to experience that way laser imax also watched it again later on hbo max then canceled my subscription
3499,3494,Aaron,gonna go watch spiderman in theater last movie i saw in theaters was star wars in 
3500,3495,Deon Benjamin,i watch movies on my phone

3502,3497,Martin O,im good large screen tv coconut oil heirloom popcorn and the bad stuff butter i get online that with a cherry coke and i can pause it and use the bathroom if needed  sorry
3503,3498,Stiven G Arrieta,hodl amc 
3504,3499,RoScFan,nowadays quottheatersquot means more than just quottheatersquot there s imax and dx those are special experiences that can never be replicated at home
3505,3500,TheShrew,we should stream everything i prefer the convenience and my own popcorn
3506,3501,Vedesh,its almost like shopping online its easier but we prefer going in person and trying clothes on
3507,3502,Kimberly Hsieh,ans because of people like meeeeeee
3508,3503,T.,please put volume up
3509,3504,Christina Lynn,personally i prefer live theater the movie theater experience is unpleasant unless the movie is  plus stars
3510,3505,EDM 79,i think it depends for sure only time will tell personally i would rather go to the cinemas and watch films rather than having it at home it is better to get out of the house and leave rather than having people come over and vice versa plus the sound is better unless you have a great cinema sound system although i guess at home you have the privacy and it is cheaper for sure since prices for tickets are double digits also you could sit or lie on the sofa and floor so it depends to the consumer and person as for me i hope cinemas will adapt to make it future and environmentally sustainable and a  better cinematic experience
3511,3506,Tyler Ton,i hope theaters dont go away the experience watching movies in theaters cannot be matched by streaming from home
3512,3507,Kyle Tucker,exactly which is why i found it amusing when people were talking about them being taken out by the pandemic the comparison was to movie rental stores going away but that was a terrible comparison they offered a similar experience for higher prices and arguably more inconvenience with theaters unless you have a good amount of money you just cant replace the experience at home
3513,3508,Ibadurrohman Musthofa,true facts
3514,3509,matt_tron101,true that 
3515,3510,swap709,if i absolutely did not have to go to a theatre ever again i wouldnt ive seen two movies in a theatre since the pandemic started
3516,3511,Doncarlo Agustino,yet youre still going anyway
3517,3512,Lon Nease,i cant believe you didnt mention ease of piracy as one of the key reasons movie companies want to keep the exclusive theatrical window black widow a day and date release saw a huge drop after the first week and most people think that was because it was so easy to immediately pirate the film from streaming it taught disney how critical the exclusive window is to their billiondollar money making films and theyve backed off day and date since
3518,3513,Ocean,amc 
3519,3514,97 EAST,the local movie theater small family owned but was the best one in the area and served our community for years  covid and streaming killed it they couldnt survive the pandemic 
3520,3515,Connor Fitz-D,i enjoy watching movies in the comfort of my own home but nothing beats going to the cinema
3521,3516,CharlieNg,i can only focus on the movie when i am in the theater how do you people even watch a movie with all those distraction
3522,3517,Adrian A,straight to video or direct to video carries a connotation that its a bad movie so having it go through the theaters help gain some sort of prestige or at least legitimacy
3523,3518,Silent Don,i pray the day theatres close down forever never happens
3524,3519,Sam Louis,no streaming platform can replace theatrical experience
3525,3520,Mike Li,between imax vs at home i choose imax but between regular theater movies vs at home i rather just stay in the comfort of my home
3526,3521,Lala,honestly ive been going to theaters even more than i used to before covid now i really appreciate watching new movies on a giant screen with a friend
3527,3522,Quig Pig,movie theaters arent dead what the are talking about its not a thing of the past at all
3528,3523,Domanic Jordan,wish this would have mentioned the black widow issue and how it worked into this dynamic
3529,3524,DragonHunter25,cant wait for a future where the only way to enjoy films will be to buy th different streaming subscription at  monthly each
3530,3525,Yeezy,i only watch movies which i dont like or not hyped about at home major blockbuster movies will always be seen in theatres first
3531,3526,J Crow,thousands of amc investors aka apes are eating ramen putting off their electric bill just so they can buy more amc stockbr  mostly because pumpers keep lying about the price going to  plus brbrbut as movie fans we shall salute them and thank them for their services and relentless hodlin
3532,3527,J,i dont think they quotsurvivedquot the pandemic theyre on blockbuster road
3533,3528,Book Lover,movie theaterscinemas give people the opportunity of sitting alone together
3534,3529,Sicao is dead,theres no replicable feeling that a traditional cinema gives you its everything getting the tickets walking through the large hallways and rooms to find your screen getting that cinema popcorn which just hits differently then finding your seat and getting comfy ready for the lights to go off then of course enjoy the movie on the big screen
3535,3530,a,you forgot paying a small fortune for the tickets and snacks
3536,3531,Jonna King,i understand and feel all of that going to the movies is about more than just the movie sadly zoomer generation just doesnt get any of that
3537,3532,Jonna King, yeah who cares i can afford a good night out once a week like that its worth it to me
3538,3533,Alley Cat,drive in movie theaters became a boom during the pandemic since your in your car
3539,3534,Richard Landgren,theaters could vanish right now and i wouldnt even notice im much happier watching at home away from all the noise and distraction harbored by a crowded theater
3540,3535,Serhii,i call it civilized capitalism
3541,3536,LilacDoe,i wonder how online piracy is influencing the desire for shorter exclusivities
3542,3537,Cycklist,completely uscentric at least put that in the title to avoid wasting everyone elses time
3543,3538,Ben,mcu is the luckiest out there they released avengers endgame in  before there was a pandemic in the same year and managed to make billions in box office  brbrhad they released it in  or  they wouldnt reached those figures
3544,3539,Zach T,in theaters movies are much more immersive and things like sound design come to life cinema is still the premiere way to see a movie
3545,3540,MovieGuy666,not with todays tvs  and sound systems its not
3546,3541,Antonio S,which movie theater corp paid for this i can do without the peoples phones going off on facetime crying kids and weird smells when in the theater to home me please
3547,3542,reckonerwheel,just kickin around some theories but i think movie theatres will stick around for a while because as a culture its seen as an activity to do with friends or to just get out of the house there might not be enough people to justify a huge theatre in a midsize city in the future but the theatre will exist in some capacity
3548,3543,Prime 98K,i think this is a more of an reasonable answerbryou can get a cinema experience at home if you can spend on it but the activity of going to the movie theatres is also worth than the movie itself
3549,3544,Jonna King,i like that quotto just get out of the housequot that is something zoomers dont seem to get whats scary and sad is i worked at a movie theater from  and it was packed with teenagers every fri night  doesnt feel like that long ago but ive heard teens today say they have literally never been to a movie theater i cant imagine being a highschooler and never having been to the movies
3550,3545,Dosomestuff, k thats the thing most people dont wanna spend over  dollars on a set up at home
3551,3546,KR Mayer,i dont think theaters or hollywood executives understand what theyre selling in a movie theatre the tiniest bit brbrin theaters we enjoy some of the last shreds of broad community in the whole swath of the commercialized world  we are buying some of the last peaceful togetherness left in american societybrbr sitting quietly with others in the dark around a single light and a single story is a human activity weve been sharing since we became human its unkillable because its part of the fabric of our survival
3552,3547,Housewarmin,veiwing a movie in theaters vs on a streming servies are two very different expiriences same way going to a concert or broadway play  etc is totally different than viewing at home
3553,3548,Wolflex,imagine not using utorrent
3554,3549,Habba Han,movie theatres are a thing of past who likes them anywaysbrcontrary to most comments here cinemas offer inferior experience
3555,3550,Simply Epic,frankly i dont think streaming movies on streaming services will be the thing to end theaters i think high budget tv shows will be the thing to end theaters brbrhaving the ability to tell longer and more developed stories with a tv show has only become more and more popular over the past few years i mean just look at the popularity of shows like the mandalorian wandavision loki arcane etc the draw of streaming has never been the movies its always been the shows i think well see studios and directors start to prefer the streaming tv format over the theatrical movie format in years to come theaters will continue to dominate movies but movies themselves will begin to become less popular
3556,3551,reckonerwheel,hmm therell always be a market for the  minute feature its just enough time to get invested in the narrative and feel pay off at the ending without needing to invest hours of ones time besides when a movie does well and audiences want more it tends to get a sequel anyway movie series like harry potter are more or less tv shows just with longer episodes and shorter seasonsbrbri think high quality tv has pulled the attention of the public for sure but not negatively and i think what it has done is made film studios realize they cant coast on formulaic comedies or action movies anymore because viewers now have a lot of good alternative content to choose from they have to truly be creative to get people watching
3557,3552,Martin Go,i refuse to pay over  for any new release even if it didnt make it to the theaters no way in heck im paying  to rent a movie  ever
3558,3553,Timberwolfe,i think theaters should get  months of only available in theaters  make it the lawbrbrsure i like turning on my stream and seeing new moviesbuti know nothing about it no hype no reviews from friendsbrmovie theaters do that and its much more fun than watching alone in your bedroom
3559,3554,Martin Go,what gets me so upset is that the streaming cost is so high get the fact that they dont even produce a dvd
3560,3555,shreya love,a good example of this issue is the scarjo vs disney issue
3561,3556,Zachary,streaming you dinosaur
3562,3557,Thibault Molleman,what about disney plus premiere access
3563,3558,Mayon Go,when raya almost killed theaters but failed
3564,3559,Chloe Johnson,you should do a video on why there arent more theaters showing old movies theres a theater in san francisco the castro that shows old favorites like back to the future and they get people coming in for the nostalgia i hardly know any other theaters in the bay area that do that i dont think movies were necessarily better but i do think we tend to remember the good ones so we have this huge back catalog of great older movies
3565,3560,sor3999,quoteventizesquot is completely right even in the s a movie that went straight to tv or vhs didnt capture the publics attention as well as a one thats in theatres i didnt even know trolls world tour was released straight to streaming maybe its just a question of marketing
3566,3561,Lotte Johnson,its technically called quotevent cinemaquot 
3567,3562,TheJadedJames,im not in the target audience for trolls world tour but i remember hearing about the controversy its release caused
3568,3563,Choekaas,this is also why film festivals arent silently falling away but rather the opposite when the film is part of the event events like that while streaming a qampa after the film logging the movie on letterboxd sharing your experience going to a premiere on social media and so on anniversary screenings of remastered classics or obscure southasian cinema that wont be available elsewhere for instance quotmemoriaquot and the whole quotthis film will only be in theatresquotmove doing something unique exciting and fun that is not replaced by something you see in your home
3569,3564,Che Tra,unless youre an introvert
3570,3565,Elijah,yeah i never even heard of that trollz world tour movie until this video i think with movies hitting theaters theres a more widespread campaign to advertise and get attention towards it rather than those that just hit streaming
3571,3566,Tiana Matson,i would much rather watch a new release in theaters than at home
3572,3567,moviefan,im so happy to live in la we have the opportunity to catch even the streaming movies from netflix prime apple etc in theaters so glad i watched the power of dog and tick tick boom on the big screen
3573,3568,Simon,i think even if there were half the theater patrons as there were in  vs now its still probably be profitable for theaters to exist but i assume since  theaters as a viewing medium will be on a decline as viewing options increase when it comes to large families going to movies i think moms and dads will prefer an at home movie while date nights are still going to be popular for in person
3574,3569,bhazi numbr,theaters are the hype beast for movies
3575,3570,Anonymous,i wouldnt be surprised if i turn  years old and my local cinemark still stands its a sign of hope
3576,3571,Homie ThaReal,coming out of movie theater is like coming out the pool after  hours
3577,3572,C N,i just need the french dispatch on streaming asap 
3578,3573,Parth Patel,arent dead yet but will be
3579,3574,Raz OneOneFour,i love listening to boomers and film hipsters tell us why overpriced movie theaters are still relevant  no thank you id rather just stream it  i watched dune at home and loved every second of it  you know what else was great  i got to watch it  times and never had to pay for another movie ticket
3580,3575,Abhay Bhatt,keeping atleast some window period is in the interest of studios themselves as it encourages many people to go watch and spend on a movie in a theatre rather than simply downloading it via torrents
3581,3576,Sitting Bull,only reason why i go to the movies is if im on a date
3582,3577,craigory,i went to see benedetta an r rated movie at alamo drafthouse and forgot i was  and got kicked out by a server
3583,3578,HUNDREDAND1,long live cinema what is a film that needs to be seen in theatres
3584,3579,Adam Pavlinek,am i the only one that kept trying to rub that chalk mark off my screen
3585,3580,mbogucki1,the question is do you want to watch a movie or experience it brbruntil the day a four story d imax screen with  channels of surround sound becomes affordable for home users then nothing will beat a movie theatre
3586,3581,archie,good luck watching imax movies in quot screen
3587,3582,Matt Wolf,tvs well above quot are pretty common now granted it still isnt as good as a movie theater screen in my opinion
3588,3583,archie, wolf you dont have the same level investment on the sound department
3589,3584,A C, of people in theatres lack proper etiquette making athome options better
3590,3585,Toddler Bodybag,as someone whos family is in the theater industry all i can say is support them could you imagine a world without cinemas dont sneak your snacks in dont sneak in movies youre stealing from people who are already mostly bleeding money the industry is dying due to the greed of man
3591,3586,Mugen123456789,seeing a great movie and the audience cheering and filling the lobby at the end all excitedly talking about the movie was amazing i remember seeing revenge of the sith opening night it was explosive in there
3592,3587,afonsords,omg i was exactly going to mention that my best movie theater experience ever was seeing revenge of the sith when i was  years old i couldnt get enough of it saw it like  times
3593,3588,froge,i dont go to theatres often but when the occasional movie which looks worth seeing on a big screen comes out ill watch it  times in imax dune was the best experience i could have had after not going to theatres for over  years and the last movie i saw in theatres before that was  which was great as long as movies like that keep getting made there will always be a place for theatres
3594,3589,Victoria 🔥𝐆𝐨 𝐓𝐨 𝐌𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐥 [𝐋!𝐯𝐞],as anyone who loves film would probably agree the experience of going out to a movie theater is irreplaceable personally cinemas are an institution that i can never imagine going away the important thing is to have both options for people to choose from
3595,3590,scottdpt12,i cant imaging why anyone would want to see a movie in an expensive theatre if you can just watch it at home on your couch
3596,3591,Matt Wolf,the screen is bigger theres better sound and its just a more interesting experience
3597,3592,the final film bro,theaters are only expensive in the us
3598,3593,Antony D'Andrea,yes i remember years ago waiting months and months now it feels like a matter of weeks

3600,3595,h,like streaming but the big screen was fun  truth is kinda miss overpaying for so so popcorn
3601,3596,nsa3679,lets bail out cinemas bruh
3602,3597,houchi69,it is just a matter of time
3603,3598,Nes Nibila,one thing i think cinemas should do is show older films you dont just need to show new releases harry potter yr anniversary is doing really well numberswise it could be really special to see older even really old films in a cinema setting especially those filmed for that
3604,3599,Mensch,i love the cinema experience its my happy place when a film comes out i rather pay over  to see a film in a cinema than pay  a month to disney etc to see  film bryou cannot ever replicate a cinema at home no matter the tv projector or sound system
3605,3600,English IELTS,
3606,3601,9385dee7,no one is going to pay the same amount to watch a new release at home than they will to watch it in a theatre brbrtheatres are an experience watching a movie on a huge screen with room shaking speakers is an experience
3607,3602,MrHaydnSir,any of my favourite movies i wouldnt hesitate to pay double to see in theatre tomorrow  
3608,3603,MV loyolidi,its one of the last few places we have fun going out to hope they stay for a long time doing everything at home is boring
3609,3604,Kalexambing,i wonder if netflix originals will ever get realized in theaters 
3610,3605,Blaze EST,the only pros are the screen size and surround sound brbrmy only con is loud people who yell after their favorite actor or character shows up it takes away from the immersion so much brbri dont understand why they cant just sell a premium  seems fair steaming price for people who prefer to watch movies at home on release day
3611,3606,G.I. JANE,because dune just wouldnt have been the same without seeing it in imax
3612,3607,Amit Kumar,they will be dead sooner or later
3613,3608,Sam Peterson,the movie theater has evolved into a way for people to take a break from their phones and simply escape from the outside world it is rare these days for anything else to gain ones attention for  hours straight
3614,3609,M-Cool,i guess everyone went with option  because of covid
3615,3610,Julio Alberto Palomo,probably well go back to studios owning the theaters again
3616,3611,galaxy discovered,massive screen d and great audio makes me like the theaters rather than watch at home
3617,3612,Tey Treet,i still remember waiting inline to see the matrix trilogy it was an epic experience
3618,3613,Eduardo Muniz,ill never forget the experience of watching the end of inception for the first time ever in a theater the catharsis provoked by stories can be way more powerful if experienced collectively
3619,3614,mactíre604,thats where you take the side chick dont wanna risk it at home
3620,3615,Mario F,lol all the movie theatre ceos trying to rationalize going to theatres still
3621,3616,Michael Strantzalis,for the same reason concerts theater plays and live sports are not dead being and experiencing something with other people is unique
3622,3617,vicfendan,no correlation
3623,3618,Michael Strantzalis, well it seems you are unable to find the correlation
3624,3619,Teemo,thats a very good analogy if its original but me being nitpicky and the difference between the other examples are that youre watching actual humans performing live while going to theaters and watching movies at home youre watching the same thing
3625,3620,Jonna King, the getting out of the house is the fun part  i look forward to my cinema night every week it just wouldnt be the same at home
3626,3621,MysticalKO, at home the sound may be replicated but the focus no unless you have a professional home theater in a theater you really cant not pay attention you have to no matter what at home many distractions and really easy to pause and do many other distracting activities
3627,3622,Teemo, true watching movies at home i never finish watching it
3628,3623,abcdefu, at home also its watching the quotreal humansquot perform live but instead of watching the score on a huge billboard kinda thing youre watching it with a scorecard underneath on tv
3629,3624,finch2213,live events at public venues vs movies in theaters are not the same just because they are experienced with groups of strangers thats just a characteristic that both share by that thinking one could say that the waiting room at the car repair shop and movie theaters are the same because they both have popcorn and chairs and a screen on the wall
3630,3625,Alex,watching sports is sooooo boring

3635,3630,《L.V.X.MAGICK》🦋《,i dont like movies or tv much to begin with but i have never enjoyed being in a movie theater not once and with surround sound and big screens no one needs to go to a theater any more either maybe they will still be around for nostalgia for those who actually enjoyed hearing other people talk and their kids scream but i for one will not be sad if they are gone forever i can watch the  movies im willing to waste my time on that come along every  years or so happily at home
3636,3631,freaks and greeks,the cinematic experience cannot be replicated unless you are in the human trafficking business and can outsource  ppl to watch a movie with you in your living room
3637,3632,Carl Clausewitz,because of social media i dont mind watching movies in theater if you dont watch a movie as soon as possible then you will get spoiled on the internet
3638,3633,Sean Webb,i miss eating lunch at diners baseball and movie theatres havent enjoyed any of these things for two years now
3639,3634,B. Winky,movie theaters are also great for marketing the push to see the movie opening day and the box office stats are a great combination
3640,3635,Lokendra Limbu,s spiderman
3641,3636,Swan,yet word of the day
3642,3637,claudevandog,for a lot of movies watching it on a tv or computer at home just doesnt provide the same level of enjoyment as seeing it on that huge screen and booming sound system of a movie theater i think because of that even if theaters are no longer going to be the dominant way of watching films i dont think they will ever fully go away at least not anytime soon
3643,3638,Kush Kamble,the best experience i had in a cinema was watching spiderman into the spiderversebrno matter how great your home theatre is nothing will replace cinema halls for me

3650,3645,Xzxmemoxzx,i cant even tell you what the last movie i saw in theaters was lol
3651,3646,girl squad,watching films on theatres is truly just a different level than in tv or phone
3652,3647,Tim Bryan,theaters should add a service that is similar to on demand viewing they should show movies that lots of people want to watch since there are so many good movies that have been released and not everyone got to see them on the big screen i could see this being a bigger draw than showing whatever the studios have decided to pump out
3653,3648,Felipe OA,i really hope this becomes a thing theres so many movies id love to watch delor rewatchdel in the theater
3654,3649,Carlos Perdomo,you can do that just rent out the theater and sell the tickets yourself its called four walling and is how a lot of independent filmmakers got their films screened
3655,3650,buzzler745555,where im from we have movie houses that keep dvds that customers can choose from and view in a small theater room
3656,3651,John C,in small business owner theaters they do this and they do this quite frequently
3657,3652,Malik Ibi,cinemark kind of does that
3658,3653,Yuuya Kizami’s Psycho Ass,they already do that its called quotfathom eventquot i know because i work at a theater
3659,3654,Noel Waldvogel,imagine watching lotr in theaters
3660,3655,Eric Goldfarb,amc is doing something like that with their  fan faves but i doubt itd be sustainable on a bigger scale because of the lack of marketing many people arent aware classics are playing at amc theatres every day
3661,3656,ChargerBullet,some smaller independent theaters do that so do some universities and museums some years back we went to a screening at rice university where they showed a s scifi movie in d i remember as a kid some libraries also did that with projectors its not the same as sitting in an actual theater though in my city there used to be the dollar theaters where older movies would be shown with the ticket price of  if your city is lucky to have an actual drivein they also show some classic blockbusters
3662,3657,Esteban Ossa Alarcón,nothing like watching a movie and dedicating  of your attention to it theaters
3663,3658,Who Asked,honestly im just gonna buy a projector and rent a warehouse its almost the same experience
3664,3659,youssef barbar,thats good content
3665,3660,Ramadhan,who win customer
3666,3661,Jay Wolin,you hear it time and time again from directors and actors some films are made to be seen on a big screen for instance i watched dune at home through hbo max but i also say it in the theater on an imax screen seeing that film at home just didnt do it justice
3667,3662,tahreesuh,you can never beat the experience of a movie theater i already have plans to go see the new spiderman movie in one of my cities nicest theaters with reclining seats
3668,3663,poolerboy 0077,timothe chalamets unrivaled beauty cannot be witnessed on a measly tv screen it must be experienced theatrically 
3669,3664,Fyn Kozari,what if the measly tv screen is  inch k oled by sony or lg
3670,3665,poolerboy 0077, kozari ifooli ltslaps facegt you need imax to get the full experience
3671,3666,no name,exactly
3672,3667,Florian ĸarl,studios only need theaters because a theatrical release is necessary for awardsbrif they want an oscar the have to show it in theaters
3673,3668,Majesty Williams,i wish they would release tenet again in imax because i missed it when it was rereleased  i have the bluray but havent watched it yet
3674,3669,Tom,buy amc calls got it
3675,3670,Majesty Williams,nothing beats going to a large theater and seeing a movie with people who are just as eager to experience the film its more than just watching a film its an experience i still remember what it felt like watching my favorite movie of all time aliens in a theater i wouldnt have felt that watching it for the first time on hbo 
3676,3671,Durgesh Sharma Luckhoo,personally  some movies are better in cinema and some are better on tv  for example avengersendgame was better on cinema while thejoker was better on tv 
3677,3672,Matt Wolf,i saw both in the theater i preferred both in the theater
3678,3673,Guto Bernardo,for me going to the movies is the same as going to a club or a caf i can experience music and good food at the comfort of my home but the atmosphere will always be different if we go out
3679,3674,Extraneus,striaght to video movies are amazing though no need for theaters just sell people garbage 
3680,3675,Steve.Tube85NL,if youre living in a big city maybe yes out in the country most theatres rock a k projector k if youre lucky streaming quality at home has surpassed that with dolby vision and atmos available everywhere
3681,3676,mbogucki1,i can see that one of the factors i use to judge whether an area is worth moving too is the proximity of the theatre with imax vip and in canada ultraavx if i cant drive to it within mins its not worth living there
3682,3677,totempolejoe,streaming quality at home has absolutely not surpassed that even a k dolby atmos stream isnt as high quality in either video or audio as a proper k dolby atmos cinema with k bluray its a different discussion but thats not streaming granted i dont think most people care about video or audio fidelitybrbrand as someone who lives quotout in the countryquot the internet here isnt even capable of reliably delivering hd video much less k dolby vision seriously most of the youtube videos i watched this morning didnt reach past p resolution and there was still buffering the theater i tend to go to isnt highend by most standards but it obliterates the experience i get with streaming at home
3683,3678,Atharva Bedarkar,watching movies at home can never replace watching movies at theatre its a big difference 
3684,3679,DS,never once have i thought quotman its quiet in my house i really wish there was an atmosphere of degens talking through this moviequot
3685,3680,InTheMindofKenZi,i like watching from home im pro streaming
3686,3681,slorr55,watching movies at home isnt the same there are distractions you can pause if you get bored you look at your phone you move around the experiance in a theater is just so much better hopefully with time it will stabilize again
3687,3682,GameBoyGreg,so this tells me that the theater experience has to expand and be more luxurious for the person that goes to the movies have to give the customer a unique experience
3688,3683,growingup15,i recently built a home theater in my home with a full on projector and surroud sound system made to work with streaming vhs and dvds and it partially feels like im in a movie theater but i still dont have that grand scale feeling and smell you get when you go to an actual theater the experience of going to a movie still holds strong in my heartbrbrits like the days of going to midnight releases for games or going to blockbuster on a friday night to pick a set of movies for the weekend to watch with your friends and family its an experience that you cant replicate with streaming
3689,3684,Tommy Reed,i would happily go to the movies if the movies were worth watching lol everything that comes out nowadays is so bad that probably hurts theaters more than anything
3690,3685,Joseph Macy,bold word quoteverythingquot
3691,3686,Gary Brimer,sadly i dont think it is hurting theaters because most people who go to theaters arent there for a movie they could be showing camera travels through a tunnel and you can hear some jokes while speakers make sounds on both sides of you and add some deep bass drops as long as the people there know that other people are herding in for the same experience they would gladly go
3692,3687,Kyle Tucker, okay
3693,3688,Steven Martinez,never going to be  they have the best screen like snacks anybody can make
3694,3689,Hanna Wilson,dont sign me up for theaters ill wait
3695,3690,Tiger800 XCx,i enjoyed going to movie theaters and taking off my mask for the entire film food or no food
3696,3691,Wolf Rawrrr,cinema advantages big screen and great sound cinematic experiencebrcinema disadvantages overpriced food and drinks waiting in lines putting up with other peoples behavior while watching brbroverall prefer watching at home but every now and then that cinema quotfeel quot is just nice
3697,3692,Doncarlo Agustino,the quotfeelquot comes from knowing random people have also experienced the same thing and that you had to focus on it the whole time instead of having the option to pause it and get distracted by something else
3698,3693,Wolf Rawrrr, agustino maybe for you but for me its def the big screen and loud speakers bb if i could rent the whole place to myself i would lolbrbri did in fact see movies before in next to empty theaters it was amazing lol
3699,3694,ghost mall,comparing watching movies at home on a tablet or tv to seeing them in a theater is like comparing listening to an album at home to seeing the van live in other words theres really no comparison they are distinct experiences
3700,3695,BlueFourDelta,what about actor pay deals for box office profit sharing instead of large upfront payments big contentcontext missing from this video
3701,3696,Manjunath Swamy,rich guys enjoy theatre feel in home normal people should go to theatre
3702,3697,ghost mall,my wife and i were just starting to get back into going to our local theater when the pandemic hit glad its open again i dont care what kind of home system you have  nothing beats the theater experience   
3703,3698,Vucub Caquix,i will never abandon movie theatersbrbryou can replicate the audiovisual experience at home as best you can but the theater forces you to engage with the movie in a way that cant be replicated at homebrbrthis helps me suspend my disbelief and for two hours or so im in another world  its like magic
3704,3699,Sameer Abdulqader,read my mind and what makes it even better is when you know youre not doing it alone that all the other people in the theater are able to go on that journey with you right there in the theater it brings a social aspect to the experience that tvs just cant capture
3705,3700,Jonna King,totally agree
3706,3701,Che Tra,introvert me is hightly disagree 
3707,3702,Marcheski TV,dune is an amazing example of this the experience of it in theatres cannot be replicated at home
3708,3703,Crimson Fox, tra im an introvert agree with the person although it definitely feels awkward sometimes
3709,3704,Erez Solomon, tv thats the only movie ive seen in almost  years in cinema and in general
3710,3705,Mr. Creasy,if this keeps up  years from now well be looking at movie theaters like we do now with blockbuster as a relic of a bygone era itll be interesting to see how this develops in the upcoming years
3711,3706,Vikhyat Puri,id still prefer watching a movie on theatre as the without distraction environment focusing on just the storyline comes with theaters only 
3712,3707,Eric Mollenthiel,last movie i saw in a theater saving private ryan  to each is own
3713,3708,Santarpan Roy,i love movie theater
3714,3709,Gilbert Nicholas,i cant watch movies at home i fall asleep every time
3715,3710,Deccan,i actually enjoy watching a movie in theaters especially now a days where a lot of theaters have upgraded to lounges please dont mess it up movie theater popcorn just hit different
3716,3711,Master Fro,the reason i still prefer theaters over watching movies at home is because of the difference in sound quality brdramatic or intense scenes just dont hit  the same when watching on a cheap k tv
3717,3712,Vedavyas Munugoor,i think in the future theaters will have to adjust from just being about watching the movie to being about the experience as a whole lots of theaters already offer food drinks etc brbrtheaters need to be almost like an amusement park experience if they want to survive i know that for example in india theaterwatching is much more of an experience pregaming the movie by firing off fireworks outside people partying outside the theater etc and i suspect the industry is heading that way
3718,3713,Anthony Lee,ya i never plan on going to a theatre again
3719,3714,Emely Hedgehog,watching avengers endgame or any other anticipated moviewith everyone in theaters was an experience that just cant be replicated at home
3720,3715,Adrian Villanueva,you do have a point
3721,3716,EuroBoy,ikr everybody was screaming and crying it was amazing lol
3722,3717,Dicky Ramadhan,yep people do be saying they prefer to be home cuz its more private avoiding noises or light coming from phone or a kick from peole behind yes i do admit those are the things i hate about theatre but getting those annoying things in return of the great atmosphere from audiences as they show exactly the same excitement and emotion as us when watching a movie yes i take it rather than having that excitement and feeling alone in the room beside to be as equal as theatre quality i think youll need to spend thousand of bucks
3723,3718,Alicia Kim,aka marvel movies lol
3724,3719,Nicholas,go watch spiderman soon if you like that atmosphere
3725,3720,Emely Hedgehog, dude you have no idea how excited i am for that i gotta wait till tomorrow tho
3726,3721,Kacper Włoch,for me it was the experience of watching infinity war in thearer the silence at the end was really quite something most people had no idea there was going to be another sequel
3727,3722,Katya_Velour,same with spiderman no way home it was the best movie experience ive had in my life and the audience reaction was absolutely priceless
3728,3723,YrboyTEN,velour it was cray cray
3729,3724,Danny Boiii,i pray cinema prevails its helped me so much i cant imagine a world without it
3730,3725,Adrian Villanueva,forget mulan 
3731,3726,Adrian Villanueva,the matrix resurrections was a box office bomb
3732,3727,Avii Tiwari,billion comment
3733,3728,Saksham Rao,endgame is so overrated
3734,3729,GazZ GS,metaverse will make that happen before 
3735,3730,Laito Starr Moonlight,definitely second your point for that
3736,3731,Joerie Sto. Domingo,i was about to cry while watching it but i dont want others to see me i cried  tho lol
3737,3732,Future,the shouting and crying irritates me tho
3738,3733,abcdefu, villanueva you mean a hit or a flop
3739,3734,Dani,i hate this kind of audiences
3740,3735,FZJanimated,yea the final scene of that movie and everyone screaming and applauding was awesome there was this couple the boyfriend was so hyped  while trying to explain to his gf who those characters were and she was giggling while the dude was losing his mind
3741,3736,Narja,i watched endgame and black panther on opening day the theaters werent full no one cheered it was a morning showing tho
3742,3737,Crafty Pasta,seeing avengers endgame in the cinema is an experience i will never forget we all cheered at the start of the final battle and cried at the ending it was amazing and i hope i get to experience that again
3743,3738,James Watson,facts
3744,3739,James Watson,even theaters make smaller movies better
3745,3740,Xenoplayz,theyre not dead yet because its a fun place to go with family or a friend not everyone has the best tv and sound system that a cinema offers for about a tenner
3746,3741,InCrIpTiOn,the only reason i stopped going to theatres was because the sound quality is better at home with a pair of good quality headphones
3747,3742,damian lara,amc to the moon
3748,3743,kasa,i mean you just cant replicate theater experience even private theaters constructed by millionaires with same technology and even companies as actual theaters are not the same because of the size difference
3749,3744,Bob dabiuld,movie theaters have a lot going for them  theres the social aspectyou and your friends get together and share an experience  theres the comfort aspectnice recliners are nearly ubiquitous at theaters  even the concessions which are expensive arent things people normally buy outside of a theater  sure we can totally use the metaverse to recreate the experience but its going to be a while before people see vr as being equivalent to a true theater experience
3750,3745,LeadHammer,window what window depending on where you are and how badly you want to watch a particular movie you can watch it even before it hits theaters
3751,3746,phantom mohawk,only the immersive atmosphere is what is keeping theatres alive if vr and spatial audio because a mainstream   where the headsets are actually comfortable  theatre will collapse that bulky headset is its only drawback
3752,3747,スペクトル,this video is sponsored by theaters
3753,3748,christopher tran,i prefer theatresbrinstead of streaming i just pirate i cant be the only one
3754,3749,Kanishka Wijesekara,vr headsets in the future will bankrupt theatres just like how apple and samsung destroyed nokia
3755,3750,TierraD2021,as anyone who loves film would probably agree the experience of going out to a movie theater is irreplaceable personally cinemas are an institution that i can never imagine going away the important thing is to have both options for people to choose from
3756,3751,Gary Brimer,i love film i would not agree
3757,3752,Fyn Kozari,i like to watch movies at home without interruptions from people making noises and smartphone lights during the movies
3758,3753,小林新,yeah i wont like it if film theaters go away i do like ondemand but ive always wanted to go to an imax theater yet i havent because of a busy schedule i want to experience that film theaters just feel different compared to just choosing your film on tv
3759,3754,K R Rangarajan, kozari the hype and enthusiasm for movies like endgame and no way home cannot be felt at home the magic of thatres is needed
3760,3755,Gary Brimer, r rangarajan the hype is exactly right hype is flash in the pan and fades quickly endgame was the last movie i saw in a theater it was a marveldisney super hero movie and nothing more the movie and series became quite predictable and formulaic as soon as they knew it would make money these are not good movies they are just roller coasters real movies its emotional and thought provoking scenes do not benefit from being on a roller coaster
3761,3756,Gary Brimer, sorry to say imax is just a louder movie with a bigger screen and weird seats if youre watching it in d prepared for that to be a layer of total nonsense to distract you from a mediocre movie
3762,3757,小林新, brimer aww well in any case i would still wanna see it for myself
3763,3758,Songs,what experience i better watch in comfort of my home without sitting on seats where someone just fucced kids crying
3764,3759,Fortimus Prime,amen nothing like watching a film on a giant screen with a bunch of strangers and at times family and friends the theater is a special experience
3765,3760,Well Silver,unless movie theatres make a big investment and make lots of change wich they dont even have enough money to do they could very well go out of business what i have in mind is a massive theatre being renovated to have many smaller theatres wich people can rent time in like a  person large theatre instead of  person large theatre and just have a database of all the movies and have the capability to show them in all the minitheatres
3766,3761,Raheem D, what films are you watching with kids in the cinema to begin with
3767,3762,tido almond, brimer thats basically every single movie though most movies are predictable
3768,3763,Calvin,the most important thing is how they strike a balance among all parties involving in this mega industry i cannot imagine one day if all movie theaters are closed down where i am supposed to bring my kids for all these nice movies because these experiences are not the same watching at home
3769,3764,Uncreeperble,dont forget about the really loud speakers gotta love it
3770,3765,Parker Animations, brimer they are good movies they are also real movies not all of them are bad or as you say it is
3771,3766,Jonna King, kozari i like getting out of the house
3772,3767,Godrick the Grafted,they are going away tho
3773,3768,Eugenio Flores,i mean ur not wrong but they already got rid of drive ins things always change so i can see them going away im such a matter but the next new things will be big and a convenience thing
3774,3769,Jonna King, flores whats next restaurants lets just make it where we never have to leave the house cant get more convenient than that
3775,3770,Eugenio Flores, king thats exactly what im saying the us is a consuming country thats all we do all day weigher its food or tv things have gotten easier for us lol
3776,3771,Luiz Henrique Franco,i love films and i think movie theater is a terrible way to experience movie there is a lot of inconvenience that takes your attention out of the movie if you wanna actually watch the movie you have to watch at home thats the way you can see the movie details
3777,3772,youngatnaruto, silver great idea but do you mean to choose to watch old films
3778,3773,Jonna King, henrique franco and again for me and many of us going to the theater is about more than just the move its an experience all of its own   i just dont like a future in which we never leave the house quotwhy go to a restaurant when you can have the same at home and eat in the peace and quiet without interruptions of people talking babies crying etcquot  nope i may be a gen xer but that doesnt sound fun the getting out is the fun part for me any way
3779,3774,Jhin a blooming Flower, brimer kid imax is like  or  times bigger the size screen here from my normal theater and the imax d cannot be compared to your typical normal theater d
3780,3775,Matthew Walton, brimer same i dont agree either but maybe its just because im young  and i find the whole theater experience a hassle and overrated anyway
3781,3776,Matthew Walton, henrique franco yes agreed not only can you pause at home but its so much easier ironically to notice small details when you arent fixated on one part of the screen because its too large and sound can sometimes be muffled the score might be louder than the dialogue something i find extremely annoying and you dont have to worry about the overexcited kid behind you kicking the back of your seat
3782,3777,Gary Brimer, walton im  i dont think age has much to do with it honestly if people want to keep throwing ridiculous amounts of money at bad movies i guess thats their right as long as someone is willing to stand there and capitalize on it the revolution will not be streamed or shown in theaters
3783,3778,Pyrogames,if u want to respect the director work you have to go to the cinema thats the only way to  enjoy and live the art from the sounds to the colors
3784,3779,Patrick Karp, the grafted no they are not going away and they never will they are here steaming doesnt beat theaters and they will go away from studios favored big money revenue and billion dollar profits from movies being played in the cinema
3785,3780,Patrick Karp, silver terrible idea fyi theaters already has the feature to book the theaters for yourself and your friends and family so you are asking cor something that already exists but it should be big theaters kept with lthe  seats that creates a bigger hype for huge movies with huge momentum such as avanger endgame nothing wrong with operation of theaters its better than at home that always will lose to theaters and theaters will remain the future
3786,3781,Godrick the Grafted, karp i love cinemas but streaming is becoming way more profitable and marvel is pushing a lot of studios out of cinema
3787,3782,Ariola Granola, brimer its a big screen and theres popcorn its fun
3788,3783,Gary Brimer, granola wanting to respond to this comment makes me feel like im being set up for the beginning of a late s bill murray movie where im going to learn what life is really about
3789,3784,Jonna King, walton for me that is whats scary and mindblowing just a few short years ago young people loved going to the theater fri night at the movie theater was the hot spot for teenagers now young ppl look at it as a quothasslequot  i cant imagine high school life withought going to the movie theater its always been part of a high schoolers life and now there are teens who say they have literally never been to a movie theater scary the type of shift can happen in just  or so years
3790,3785,Bryan Cash,spider man to the rescue theaters are wonderful
3791,3786,Ken Belangel,i think the one thing that can make theaters old is having a vr headset that looks like youre in those theaters it just needs real people in it too or its better because no one in vr can distract the experience
3792,3787,Marc o,oculus already supports movies but not everyone is comfortable with vr
3793,3788,James Ducas,even a middling home theater setup is preferable to going out nothing ruins a movie theater experience quicker than getting bad seats someone behind you snoring having to go to the bathroom or overpaying for snacks
3794,3789,Angie S,the art house movies are dying now movies dont need to have expensive graphics to give good experiences
3795,3790,Anna Barr,tv series got better and movies worse theatre chains dont show arthouse films and now streaming sites are buying them up i live in paris and i go to see films from the s and s and that i never got to see before on the big screen worth the money
3796,3791,Lonell Fletcher,maybe im old school but i hate this shortening of the theatrical window let these movies breath make movies an event again i miss how it used to be
3797,3792,Dealing With It,i know this isnt true everywhere but in the rural place i live its much cheaper to see a movie in the theater than it is to rent or buy it anytime near the release date my local theater is  a ticket for most shows last night in soho is still  to watch at home
3798,3793,Sushant_K9,and it wont as long as imax lives
3799,3794,Michael JF,yeah too bad music concerts dont exist at all anymore ever since mp players came out
3800,3795,TerraSai,after watching dune in theaters i could never watch it at home it just wouldnt be the same
3801,3796,Raymando,just because audiobooks or ebooks exist books arent dead sames gonna go with movie theatres the alternatives are convenient for sure but just not the same
3802,3797,Know direction,matrix 
3803,3798,heio,where i come from kuwait movie theaters are a major source of entertainment especially on weekends mainly because we have very limited available entertainment options and summers are exceptionally hot  plus the fact alcohol is banned made things much worse
3804,3799,Brandon Smith,if i could watch movies from home for a reasonable price not  more expensive than going to the theatre id very rarely go to the theatre again
3805,3800,J e e K,if a movie is released in theater and on streaming service at the same time ill still go and watch it in the theater movies are meant to be watched on the big screen its a whole experience that can never be experienced on a laptop or tv screen unless you are rich and have a home theater
3806,3801,LeadHammer,movie theater what is that is it where they sell you overpriced soda is it where they show you twenty minutes of ads before a movie is it where people talk loudly and put their feet on the back of a seat in front of them no thank you
3807,3802,Oncopoda,i wish desperately for same day releases people who value seeing movies on theatres will also go anyway people like me who dont like shared movie experiences should have the option to see blockbusters at home on release day
3808,3803,Kyle Tucker, not happening any time soon as explained in the video theaters are good for everyone when they have exclusive release periods including actors who dont get a cut of the streaming money but do get a percentage of box office as long as thats the case you will never see same day releases if they have the option
3809,3804,H21 Lad,movie theaters arent dead yet
3810,3805,Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,the whole point of watching a movie at home  is to not have the same experience as in a theater if you invest enough money into  a home cinema system you can even get that obnoxious random cough sound effect they have in the theaters
3811,3806,Kyle Tucker,well  not everyone has the money or acoustics for that and  many many people want the theater experience
3812,3807,Peter,getting tickets sneaking snacks in and watching a highly anticipated movie with your friendsfamily in a space with great audio and fantastic ambience is the reason i still go to see movies in the theater that experience cant be replicated elsewhere i dont see more than  or so movies a year in the theaters but its always fun
3813,3808,Make Racists Afraid Again,i havent been inside a theater since the first iron man movie
3814,3809,Mike King,helli can wait till they play them on regular tv
3815,3810,G Martines,i know one thingbrwe all have to go watch spiderman no way home in theatres
3816,3811,Mirko Ivancic,great video but a small thing  the graphics is way off for toy  story  it says june  but graphics shows it closer to july thish
3817,3812,Miss Tee,it can never be dead watching a movie on a huge screen is a whole other experience you cant get when you watch it at home
3818,3813,Omar Guardado,if movie theaters disappear i will simply not be able to go on
3819,3814,MJ,in this day movie theater in the philippines in my city is still closed since march  your lucky in the us because movie theater is open
3820,3815,Kmony,im trying to get interstellar to show on imax again but might have to wait and just hope they come out with a  year anniversary screening of it in  i just watched it last week and regret not watching it in theaters
3821,3816,The Grinderman,i saw it last year in imax and while it was great the volume was too loud to the point of being slightly painful
3822,3817,Elite Ethan,anyone seeing this right after the sonic the hedgehog  trailer
3823,3818,Ivan Raimi,because where else to go with your gf
3824,3819,Leigh,release both on streaming and cinema at the same time and lets see who wins
3825,3820,Kyle George,marvel size event films are what cinemas are for while smaller dramatic films are what streaming is for
3826,3821,Financial Shinanigan,having a  year old made me appreciate being able to watch latest movies at home instead of needing to set aside minimum  hours to go in person
3827,3822,Jewelson Noronha,they are going to be in few years when vr gets cheaper
3828,3823,Y P,i remember moments when i watch movies in theaters streaming platform cant match that experience
3829,3824,BlazedYoda,why not release it at p on demand and k surround sound in cinema people who are excited for the film will pay to watch it in k while those who arent bothered snd just want to watch it will then watch it on demand both win
3830,3825,Pieceof Shitzu,i would love to see an on demand option for everything brmake it so that movie theaters still get profit or simply charge more for on demand stuff
3831,3826,Lily  👈𝓕**СК МЕ - СНЕ𝓒𝓚 𝓜𝓨 Р𝓡0𝓕𝓘𝓛Е 💗,thanks for watching let us know in the comments below if you think the movie theater experience is still something that cant be replicated and what movie youre looking forward to watching in theaters next
3832,3827,Twesha Saini,i wish you talked about black widow and scarlett johannsen suing disney because of this
3833,3828,Michelle Bennett,i really miss going to the movies my only reason i cant is kids and no babysitter unfortunately im definitely going to try to get a babysitter for the new matrix
3834,3829,Nakib Sayyed,its sad seeing movie theatres in such condition the experience of watching a movie in theatre cannot be rivaled
3835,3830,lily     ,thanks for watching let us know in the comments below if you think the movie theater experience is still something that cant be replicated and what movie youre looking forward to watching in theaters next
3836,3831,timothy thomas,if arcane released in movies theater i will watch  times straight
3837,3832,8Teen Music,i really like it when they show it on the theater and vod they should continue it in the future
3838,3833,keshav jhunjhunwala,for people without home theatres and large tvs theatres matter alot even though i have both the things i mentioned even i prefer theatres because i cant blast the movie at full volume in my house theatres are definitely here to stay and everyone who loves the experience should support their local theatres
3839,3834,growingup15,same i have both large tv and home theater and i still love going to the movies the experience just cant be fully replicated at home
3840,3835,Anym,even with a home theatre with a giant screen the amount of rumbling bass that can bounce around in those giant cinema rooms will not be translated to home theatre for a long time
3841,3836,FilmStack,great video i recently made a video similar to this on my channel but with some different perspectives this one i missed and it was really informative
3842,3837,Valery0p 5,home video killed local theaters here a lot earlier than the virus did this is just another nail in the coffin
3843,3838,prasad Kadu,you cant make a billion dollars like avengers  in streaming services you need theatres for that
3844,3839,Lewis Guapo,i just saw kanye amp drake concert live at an imax theater sponsored by amazon i mean theres newer ways to use these platforms
3845,3840,Michael Lyden,movie theater im not deadbrdisney youre not fooling anyone
3846,3841,Ross,yes exactly having a movie that was in theaters is better than one on streaming its silly but its there
3847,3842,Chaitanya Patel,on one hand on demand movies are getting popular but on the other hand directors are making ambitious movies which can be experienced to their full extent only in theatres dune and tenet are the latest examples dune was the first movie i watched in theatre after pandemic gap of  years that experience was surreal theatres may become less important in future but they are here to stay  at least for those people like me who value the immersiveness of the large screen dark room and perfect sound
3848,3843,charlie putzel,i think i can agree with that but theaters are going to have to change their business model at least some they were already struggling prepandemic because of high prices most middleclass families will go to the theater once or twice a year as its a big splurge for a group increasingly tight on money
3849,3844,Majesty Williams,add me to that list of people who love going to the movie theater
3850,3845,Lachlan Trescott, putzel definitely not going away in rd world countries where tickets are dirt cheap and the quality of the theaters are actually high standards
3851,3846,Tidbit,thats interesting i hate theatres because the sound is always too loud and i cant pause the film or rewind  thats why i think movies should come out on all platforms at the same time so that people can choose where and how to watch and no one should be excluded because they cant afford the ridiculous price of a movie ticket
3852,3847,iSevenSimmer,totally agree i love going to the movies its an experience of its own and something to do with friends family and loved ones
3853,3848,Lev Bobrov,the theaters are also forcing their format on the directors like every movie needs to be hrs or so if that force is no longer there they can make movies as short or as long as they want
3854,3849,Compact Review,oh yeah actually dune was my best movie experience ever on one hand i wasnt in cinema for a while before that except black widow and on the other hand it is just a masterpiece tenet is a masterpiece too of course but with christopher ludwig hans and denis we always get a masterpiece right  
3855,3850,Douglas Catling,actually i think i lot of what i didnt like about dune was how exaggerated the sound and visual design was like yes we get it the spaceships are very big please move on with the story
3856,3851,Angad Channa,it was dune for me as well some movies are made to watch on big screen
3857,3852,Yours Truly,bruh forgot demon slayer mugen train which was the highest grossing movie of  you are no man of culture i see
3858,3853,Sean Deehan, putzel in a lot of places that model has already changed basically every theater now also sells beer and some sell a way more expanded food menu before the pandemic i went to the movies all the time but usually to watch some classic movie and have a couple beers as a social outing i think further quoteventizingquot the experience is the way forward
3859,3854,Gustavo Brito,perfecy dune was such an great experience
3860,3855,MimiRox13, bobrov i know it differs from country to country but usually its the studio that has the most power over a film and not the theater thats why it took so long for zack snyders  hour long justice league to release theaters dont care how long a movie is if theyre making money off of it lincoln and the irishman were both over  hours also most nigerian and indian movies are about  hours so
3861,3856,MimiRox13,i completely agree movie theaters are here to staybri think that in places like the us and maybe canada theyll just become more scarce and something rich people do
3862,3857,pewpewlazers,i love going to the movies comfy recliner spacious seats nowbut my tickets ahead of time get some snacks and enjoy with others
3863,3858,Diego Montoya,i did the same thing dune was the first movie i saw in a theater in basically two years the experience was so amazing being back in the theater that i watched james bond the next day and then the french dispatch the following weekend some movies deserve the big screen and with wes anderson filmsilove to observe the other audience members reaction to the dialogue and interactions between the characters to see if they get the jokes
3864,3859,Faraae, trescott yup movie tickets are cheap where i live however i question how profitable it is  the theater doesnt make a whole lotta money from selling tickets but they do get it from selling overpriced concessions and then again not everybody buys them
3865,3860,MarkoN555,dune was surreal watching it in imax i wish i couldve watched interstellar also in imax when it premiered imax is the only format worth paying for tbh
3866,3861,LightBluly,godzilla vs kong it doesnt feel the same watching at home now
3867,3862,linkinlinkinlinkin,the comments are full of these opinions of theaters having some tangible romantic and technical abilities which wont ever be shadowed by streaming but that is not at all the point of the video market is pushing theaters to being a romantic oneoff thing and not exclusive distributors of movies which truly is their purpose right now but this demand is nowhere near the same they had a few years ago so they will either have to buckle and plan for degrowth or go ham and expect some policy to keep up the streaming window
3868,3863,wenwei su,for certain movies like scifi cinemas and especially imax are the only way to enjoy the movies even for rom coms and comedies it is more enjoyable to watch them with others in a cinema setting
3869,3864,William Parker,speaking of immersiveness vr will be replacing that
3870,3865,David Perry, putzel have movie theaters play television series too not just movies as well as oldschool movies
3871,3866,Fortimus Prime,amen nothing like watching a film on a giant screen with a bunch of strangers and at times family and friends the theater is a special experience
3872,3867,Conner Johnson,i am glad i got to see dune and tenet at my movie theater i dont think it would have the impact if i had waited to see them on a smaller tv
3873,3868,Gpaderx,one of the biggest factor that keeps theaters alive is social media there are so many spoilers to avoid spoilers the people decided to watch the movie on the first day or first week than waiting it in a dvd release or streaming company even they would shorten the window its unnecessary since the important part of the window is in the first week of the release
3874,3869,Adrian Villanueva,why not just re release the movies that flopped at the box office during  skip mulan  disney plus netflix hulu redbox amazon and apple tv will never beat cinema
3875,3870,SaudadeSunday,sure for dune and similar ill go to an imax theater real imax not the liemax garbage that most people go to for a movie with little visual impact theres no point if you have a halfway decent setup at home
3876,3871,freddywhite,dune is the first movie ive seen in a theater in over a year its also one of the highlights of this whole period for me no coincidence here
3877,3872,M AKLife,dune was a disappointment
3878,3873,mohammed sarker, catling nah those quotexaggerated effectsquot are what adds to the scale
3879,3874,Fumikato ♫,and audience reaction
3880,3875,Harshit Ramrakhyani,even i have the same opinion
3881,3876,Future,youre indian
3882,3877,Sorenkair,nah dune was just uncomfortably loud besides the imax bass rumbles i would have preferred to watch it at home
3883,3878,Megan Dunklin, catling thats how they were described in the book
3884,3879,hedgehog3180,i think in general theatres need to focus on this kind of stuff as well as perhaps being more willing to do rereleases of older movies id love it if theatres were just an undisturbed high quality movie experience and that i could also go there to experience classics once again
3885,3880,AHarice,hah my first movie was tenet after the lockdowns
3886,3881,Alessandro,spoiler you can have a large screen dark room and perfect sound at home
3887,3882,a,true i want to go see sune again in cinemas because it was so good
3888,3883,Neel Javia, trescott nahbrin my country they literally loot you for snacksbrplus the tickets are not affordable either
3889,3884,Bruhmomento,tenet and dune were something else man a true out of world experience
3890,3885,Friend O,want to be immersed get a  in oled tv  or a  in projector if you have the space ampnice dark room dolby atmos surround sound
3891,3886,Friend O, dont forget bed bugs
3892,3887,Erez Solomon, i agree with your points and conclusion but actually for theaters bbeingb too loud and not having the ability to be paused i find myself being forced to pay attention thus more immersed in the present which becomes a 
3893,3888,Justin Kelvianto,movie on theater gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgt on demand
3894,3889,Abdellah Ibrahim,i am going to cinema almost every week for almost years at this point its like telling me praying at home is better than going to the church
3895,3890,asdsdjf asdjxajiosdqw,can you do a similar video on geoblocking films and tv a lot of people in europe who would have loved to pay for the early got seasons as they were airing but had no option but to pirate them because otherwise they would have to wait sometimes more than a year to watch it legally and by then it would have been spoiled to them already
3896,3891,Ashrak Ahmed,well if studio and tv execs wants to lose money by geoblocking let them bebryou treat me like nd class citizen you dont get my money ill still watch it 
3897,3892,Addison Smith,and people love to go to the movie theaters
3898,3893,thatsrightjay,movie theaters have always been a miserable experience for me as an individual with sensory issues caused by asd the changes that the pandemic have caused in how movie are released has been the best  now  i can watch them at home with subtitles in the comfort of my home without the disruptive obnoxious people crinkling their bags whispering to each other pulling out their bright cell phones and that horrible crunch sound of popcorn  i dont think i can go back to the old ways
3899,3894,Bre,sure its easier and perhaps even comfier watching movies at home but i like the option of going out and doing something as an event or with others its overpriced but still fun every once and a while
3900,3895,Jonna King,thats me as well i just gotta get out of the house sometimes  i was reading some place that eatout restaurants may also be a thing of the past someday and that restaurants will be phone apps that you order from and they deliver that doesnt sound like a fun future to never leave the house
3901,3896,Marmolejo Martinez Jose Emilio, moncrieffe even if youre an introvert you need to see other people it has been proven that not seeing people can break you
3902,3897,Amrish Sankrityayan,your recent past  videos is totally flop its bcz not deep research not good animation and not choose decent topic for us these are major factors to continue flop your videos plz make sure focus on quality not quantity in nutshell  video monthless video more research
3903,3898,Hakuu_A19,nothing will ever replicate the cinema atmosphere
3904,3899,Sanzhar Suleimen,the issue is im not going to the theatre if it isnt out legally by the time i want to watch it im pirating it
3905,3900,Timberwolfe,and youre able to do that because of streaming platforms already showing it
3906,3901,booker dewitt,as lazytown once said do what you want cause the pirate is freeyou are a pirate
3907,3902,Juana 🔝 𝓕**СК МЕ - СНЕ𝓒𝓚 𝓜𝓨 Р𝓡0𝓕𝓘𝓛Е,sure netflix and bluray are taking over but that doesnt mean that movie theaters are dead as long as people are paying tickets and snacks movie theaters are here to stay brbri understand the pandemic hurt the theaters but so did the great depression and the  financial crisis and the theaters survived
3908,3903,Ben W,the second  version of this video theaters give a better watching experience and people cant afford building a theater in their home
3909,3904,Gary Brimer,this video actually says nothing about the watching experience it just features theater execs telling us its an experience you like things like it makes it feel like an event or it makes it feel special are all nostalgia based qualities that have nothing to do with good movies
3910,3905,Richard Landgren,wailing babies people laughing at odd times people talking people up and down to go take a leak coughs and sneezes the noise of people loudly consuming food and drink cellphones being used and ringing nah ill stick to watching at home
3911,3906,Doncarlo Agustino,its dealing with random members of the public including all their annoyances that make the film an event and common shared experience watching a movie you like at home doesnt have the same impact as watching it where you physically have to interact among strangers and get a sense of how many random people might also be quotinquot with what you watched
3912,3907,Gary Brimer, agustino  so youre saying that the theater has little to do with the movie and more to do with feeling like youre part of the crowd that the theater gives you a sense of belonging and that the only thing that mattered about the movie was that you and a few hundred other people decided they would spend money on it no thanks
3913,3908,EyesOfByes,one word imax
3914,3909,PAlMON,hi future people this video uploaded when spiderman  no way home on theater
3915,3910,Kam More,i was low key getting nervous when covid hit and they were saying movie theaters were probably going away forever the experience of going to a movie is so fun
3916,3911,FlamingSC,geez the only mention of the biggest movie theater chain that is even more profitable and still innovating with new ideas such as nfts than the smaller theater chain was quotamc is on the verge of bankruptcyquot just tells me this video is subliminal and has other intentionsbrbrvox do your homework and see why amc earlier was on the verge of bankruptcy was because of illegal shorting in the stock market that has gone unregulated by the sec until retail investors apes stepped in and saved it from illegally being driven to the ground
3917,3912,S R,im perhaps the most average person when it comes to movies but  of the movies i watch i just wait until its available digitally it is just not worth the effort to go to a movie theater unless the movie is truly exceptional for example something like quotdunkirkquot has to be seen in the imax format something cinematically mundane like quotmarriage storyquot is good to watch on my tv with a very humble sound barbrbrthese executives forget how unnecessarily expensive some movie theaters are from ticket pricing to pop cornsoda
3918,3913,daviie,i think marriage story was a direct release to netflix anyways buy i understand what you mean
3919,3914,Parth Patel,yup   agree to this
3920,3915,Erdem Oz,dude if you can not afford to go to the movies you should seriously question your life decisions
3921,3916,Hans Tshikangu,bobligatory go amc commentb
3922,3917,Jensen Raylight,there are a ton of movies with jawdropping vfx amp details  that are impossible to recreate at your homebrmovie theater and imax are the sacred way to enjoy a movie to its fullest potentialsbrif movie theater could increase the already great imax experience by x by inventing new technology i think it would hold its grounds very well against streaming
3923,3918,TheMrawesomest,i suppose it depends on the quality of the movie theater near you i would prefer to watch a k hdr version of the movie at home rather than drive to a movie theater to watch the movie on a dimly lit screen that is a bit blurry and out of focus with the distracting shadows of cobwebs that are hanging from the ceiling
3924,3919,Jensen Raylight,you realize its  right not bri never saw any blurry and out of focus movie or any shadow at the theater dude youre outdatedbrgo watch a great movie on imax first and get yourself an emotional life changing  experience
3925,3920,rkan2,absolutely  unfortunately blurays are kind of on their way out other than that  a proper home theater with a projector is the best option by far
3926,3921,Z J,or maybe go to a proper cinema
3927,3922,Dale Andrew Eugenio,maybe theater plays will make a comeback when movie theater become extinct
3928,3923,Chris Choi,nah ticket is about  in theater now only big movies gonna survive who pay that much for indiesmall pics ott is future
3929,3924,Harshil Lakhani,i watched dune on my tablet as the local theatres didnt play it in my town i would have happily and preferably paid to watch it in a thatre once the mere experience of watching that movie on a big screen would have been enough even though the movie was good it would have been twice as enjoyable on a big screen as that movie was literally made for a cinematic experience so yeah bro theatres arent going anywhere anytime soon
3930,3925,JamextheGreat,i manage a movie theatre ask me anything
3931,3926,Masud Rintu,whatever inch my tv or devices in my home i love going in to the theatres
3932,3927,ejonesss,the movie the interview due to its controversy they did did an immediate dvd and streaming due to threats made to some theatersbrbrthe only way that theaters could survive the pandemic is if movies are shown in theaters only due to the content like all rated r movies due to the raunchy content as theaters can secure the movie easier and prevent under age viewing than with streaming services
3933,3928,MF DOOM that's a super villain!,bnothin beatsbbrseein a good movie  in a room full of people experiencing that raw reaction from the audiencebrbrbutbr  america is gettin too blazy amp comfortableb people dont like leavin the house anymore
3934,3929,STEEZYASFUCK,amc to the moon
3935,3930,LeaveItorSinkIt,movie theatres are overrated
3936,3931,Vanda Lyadinskaya,in my experience a new movie was never available in the movie theatre for so long definitely not for months so what was usually happening was that or you watch it in the movie theatre within few weeks after the release or  have to wait all these months until the digital version is out
3937,3932,Mela,what they say the experience in movie theaters are never be the same at home
3938,3933,Medusa,cause we like themthats why
3939,3934,KASCH's UTube CHANNEL,what about the actors scarlett johansson lawsuit
3940,3935,Tone Riggz,i love my movie collection and streaming but going to the movies is an experience cant replace it even with a state of the art home theater setup
3941,3936,Lewis Hamilton,i remember when in britain major releases would come out about  months after they did in the us and canada it ended because online piracy became such a problem that they aligned the release windows
3942,3937,AssafChriqui,yep they forgot to discuss piracy in the video once a film goes to digital release it automatically available in online piracy america has a great variety of digital vods or streaming services that other countries dont have sometimes the only way to watch certain movies abroad is in theatres or in online piracy because its not available digitally otherwise
3943,3938,King Barnaby, yep i lived in third world countries for a lot of my life many many movies are still not available anywhere but piracy even disney isnt available here until 
3944,3939,Shafwan Dito,i remember back before thor ragnarok show up marvel didnt make asia as no priority in term of release datebrbrbut after thor ragnarok and the teaser of infinity war marvel make asia as the first region to get cinema release simultaneously as a person who live in a third world country in asia it is such a blessing of privileged to have from western countries lol
3945,3940,Millenial Gamer, dito which country
3946,3941,Dayyan Ahmad, gamer india brhere spiderman nwh released  day before america
3947,3942,back ground,honestly i like theaters you got food drinks high quality movie and extremely cold room and you have the feeling of build up for a movie you been waiting its like a great experience
3948,3943,Briredrose,i want to know whats up with drive in movie theaters because i felt they should have thrived during the pandemic but they didnt not really anyway people just went back to actual theaters
3949,3944,Hayes,im sure there are some people who enjoy watching everything at home but theres just something different about going to the theater that you just dont get watching on your tv its a real event the quality of the experience is a lot better because of the soundenvironmentfoodetc movies just feel better in the theater
3950,3945,alinzelnan,for me as a german cinema doesnt interest me at all anymore since i was  and started watching all movies in their original language there are sometimes screenings of movies with the original language track but even then you only get german subtitles
3951,3946,해군 대장 :P,while netflix and other online streaming platforms are there going to cinemas makes you feel more excited about the movie you will be watching especially when you watch with your family or friends watching in cinemas just hits different
3952,3947,Michael G,i typically only go to the theatres for the more highly anticipated movies because of the big screen and audio experience watching dune on your couch just isnt even close
3953,3948,stars,the last movie i saw in theaters was rise of skywalker so that was a really terrible way to go out lol
3954,3949,Nuomi Tang,i missed the part where thats my problem
3955,3950,Quixotic End,im just waiting for the vegas super omnitheater to open up an experience like that is just far beyond anything wed have at home any time soon
3956,3951,Naomi Jones,theres always gonna be art house amp independent theaters
3957,3952,Terminal Velocity,in edinburgh scotland in  i went to the dominion cinema to watch braveheart the entire audience stood up and applauded the picture something at home will not give the experience
3958,3953,Tait's Take,theres no way i would have recovered from having to watch captain america pick up that hammer at home movie theaters are a must
3959,3954,Scott McFarlane,they are in canada this is an american thing
3960,3955,Aykhan Salmanov,comment
3961,3956,Marty D,i love going to the movies
3962,3957,Dinesh Bhat,id still go watch lotr in theaters if theyre rereleased even though ive watched it many times
3963,3958,weirdbeard,i will always prefer theaters to streaming any day
3964,3959,Huy Vu,time to reduce the power of movie theater for good
3965,3960,DenLim123,watching movies in theaters will always be an amazing experience but many movies nowadays arent even worth wasting  time to go to the theater anymore
3966,3961,zeroinone inzero,universal is going to give christopher nolans next movie  day theatrical run
3967,3962,Gucci girl,feels like i am the only one who prefers to watch movies in home
3968,3963,darkm4gician,as someone who before the pandemic used to go to the movies alone just to get some time to myself  i missed the theaters dearly during the pandemic when it comes to a movie watching experience nothing can beat going to a theater at home can be pretty distracting and theres some value to being able to disconnect sit in a dark room  with or without terrible but good food and just zoning out to whatever picture piqued your interest i hope that experience never goes away as streaming becomes more predominant looking forward to seeing spidey the matrix and kings man later this month
3969,3964,JP,im not someone who is able to appreciate the theatre experience but my gf is so i get pulled into watching movies in theaters with her while it hasnt changed my appreciation for the experience i think its a great social activity when combined with other things like dinner to talk about the movie
3970,3965,Djet Axion,im excited for the kings man
3971,3966,Gary Brimer,what part of being in a theater is being alone
3972,3967,Hanasei Levinus, brimer quotgoingquot alone
3973,3968,Gary Brimer, levinus fair enough
3974,3969,Bryan Lee,as amazing as home theaters have gotten theres still no beating the energy of the opening weekend crowd at an imax showing of a big release as long as theyre still around ill always continue to support my favorite movie theatres
3975,3970,REGAL Black,that video helped alot
3976,3971,Pratap Mishra,watch dune in theater and youll know why
3977,3972,Herra Majuri,it is good to watch at home but it is way better to watch it at movie theaters
3978,3973,hoosierhiver,vox reminds me of jonah on cloud 
3979,3974,Phakaday,i thought watching movie at  home would be better but nothing beats watching a blockbuster movie in a theater
3980,3975,rkan2,unless a home movie theater with a projector p
3981,3976,Lachlan Trescott, you could never replicate the sound system though unless you have a basement dedicated for a homecinema with k equipment which is ridiculous
3982,3977,Phakaday, still not the same for me i need to feel like i am getting ready and out to do something helps my mind focus on the movie home threater is nice but still not the same feel for me personally i always get distracted by things around the house
3983,3978,takanoritoriyama,ott
3984,3979,Christina,i dont like movies and havent seen one in years but it was interesting to learn about the business when the pandemic started i had assumed that would be the end for the theatres looks like i assumed wrongly
3985,3980,Peter Marker,its all about the experience
3986,3981,William Dunbar,at this point movie theaters are like the vestigial legs on snakes
3987,3982,Jake Estrada,dune was a great example of a movie that had to be seen in theaters made the whole thing like a hundred times better
3988,3983,Marty Jackson,i didnt even particularly like dune but i agree it definitely benefited from being on the big screen
3989,3984,ej ro,x
3990,3985,Giulia B, ro thats harsh
3991,3986,Jake Estrada,i mean as someone who went into it knowing nothing about dune besides it being scifi and having sand worms i really enjoy it literally went to barnes and noble the next day and bought the book which is also fantastic so im just curious what you guys didnt like about it
3992,3987,TacoTrucks, ro 
3993,3988,Jake Estrada, trotsky i definitely disagree with it being trash i mean i understand that not everyone is going to click with that type of movie the film itself though is fantastic from a cinematic perspective the art design soundtrack and costumes alone are incredibly well done but i can understand not liking the story or being frustrated because it doesnt follow the book or something like that to each their own
3994,3989,Gary Brimer,watched it on hbo at home loved it enjoyed it it had a good epic feel theaters are a scam
3995,3990,Dmitry Komik,dune was a grate example of a movie why i dont wanna spend extra time and money on trash films 
3996,3991,Mr Botan, brimer go to your nearest imax theatre and try to watch a film like dune again watching at home is incomparable brbrtheres a reason why the theatrical release remains film makers intend for their films to be watched there your speakers would never do a film like dune any justice i know mine dont
3997,3992,Dominic Wong, tamparong ive watched dune in theatres and i do agree that it must be seen in theatres due to its grandeur but have you not been to the theatres alone before
3998,3993,Gary Brimer, tamparong oh thanks for letting me knowbrbrso what youre saying is that the theater has nothing to do with the movie and that instead its a place to go on a date
3999,3994,Gary Brimer, botan im not trying to get that experience that experience is a roller coaster ride that has nothing to do with a movie yes i am aware that the director of dune has stated it would be a crime to watch his movie anywhere but on a theater screen i wonder what kind of kickbacks he got for thatbrbrim not trying to be rumbled and bamboozled by a loud show im trying to find some art that has meaning in a world full of rumble shows and the theater does nothing for that
4000,3995,Mr Botan, brimer you need to go at am for that back in my uni days if i had an early finish id go straight to the cinema almost no one there and you can have that theatre experience  the quietness and ability to appreciate the art brbrif you go on release day at pm on a friday you know what youre gettingbrbrlet me add if a film is loud and bamboozling in the theatre thats exactly how the creator intended for it to be watched
4001,3996,Gary Brimer, botan youre probably somewhat correct about a creators intentions but i would say thats part of movies being disposable and shallow not better brbrultimately there is nothing in a theater but inconvenience and higher cost for it even if i am totally alone ive just paid way too much to watch a movie in a weird place brbrusing the opening day pm factor arent you really saying that people who actually enjoy cinema not roller coasters would be more likely to see a movie on its opening day probably pay more for it if they could do it without all that mess hbo max got two months out of me because i wanted to see dune im still subscribed what are the overheads i enjoyed the movie ive told my friends about it im boosting the movie right now by mentioning it all they had to do was stream it for a few hours how is that not a better business model for consumers and the movie industry brbri know the answer people still want a roller coaster and they can have it but stop forcing the rest of us to endure that mess when we dont want it
4002,3997,εντροπιας γονος, estrada can i ask just one question how do you know that presumably you havent watched dune in your house so how do you know that
4003,3998,Nacho Libre,excellent picture quality but the plot is too slow and boring
4004,3999,legendp2011, brimer i have  sound system and a  inch tv  with recliners at homei still like seeing a movie in theaters i watch hoyts extreme screen similar to imax all the seats are recliners in modern cinemas seeeeing an epic movie and spenidn a night out with freeinds is a different experiance than seeing it at home
4005,4000,Gary Brimer, it is a different experience thats true i suppose what this is getting at is that there are theater people and movie people and they arent the same thing perhaps you can be both but movie people are being punished because the theater people like to spend a bunch of money on an experience that has fairly little to do with the movie  brbrwhen i say we are being punished i am referring to the theatrical window
4006,4001,Gary Brimer, well there is no convincing you that you dont like what you likebrbrit does seem like the primary option for people like me is to continue mostly ignoring movies as i have been for the last  years enjoy your roller coaster
4007,4002,A_fruityMachete,i agree
4008,4003,Rasiel Suarez, estrada kinda boring
4009,4004,Jaime Rudio, brimer couldnt agree with you more
4010,4005,Jaime Rudio, tamparong bet this guy is single and alone  only kind of person that would write a comment like that
4011,4006,Mike Oxsmal, libre they had to do it though it is a very very big book it would feel really rushed otherwise
4012,4007,Jordan W., estrada it was great they dont know what theyre talking about
4013,4008,M AKLife,lol dune was lame
4014,4009,Tony Tran,yup especially since streaming quality isnt even close to k discs yet much less a theater screen especially imax the hbo max stream of dune looked pretty terrible in some scenes i feel bad for people who only watched it on stream instead of in theaters
4015,4010,capturedby ote,quite place too
4016,4011,Luz Ysela,
4017,4012,Pepe Arown,this just feeds into the issue that modern films are made for money and not quality entertainment it was a mediocre movie but you went to see it anyways because you were in a theater
4018,4013,Eddie Rios,yes
4019,4014,SarahLee,yassssss
4020,4015,Richterman,its simple they wouldve disappeared if we coukd watch them at home in release day
4021,4016,SatansBestBuddy,quotthat doesnt mean theatres will be around foreverquot yes it does theyre selling something you couldnt get otherwise thats how they survived will there be fewer of them in the future probably but theatres will still be around
4022,4017,SuperPrem,bro nothing can replicate the theatre experience no matter how ginormous tvs get i hope the theatrical window stays around for  months imo everyone who wants the see it will get the chance
4023,4018,Cyber Trend,it wont go away watching in theaters is just way to authentic
4024,4019,arm,i like tv series on ott but i still  watch movies in cinema hall to get best experience
4025,4020,7939_Edits,so good content  i appreciate the hardwork in it
4026,4021,Cardon Ellis,wait did vox just make a video that didnt blame white people or toxic masculinity for something  maybe i will resubscribe lol
4027,4022,Brandon M,i dont even know where my closest cinema is lol
4028,4023,Isaac Martinez,sure netflix and bluray are taking over but that doesnt mean that movie theaters are dead as long as people are paying tickets and snacks movie theaters are here to stay brbri understand the pandemic hurt the theaters but so did the great depression and the  financial crisis and the theaters survived
4029,4024,Zoe Nikole,with the technological landscape of today the relationship theaters have to the public isnt comparable to that of the relationship they had with the public during the great depression brregardless movie theaters need to pivot in some manner in order to continue justifying their existence ive worked in movie theaters during this pandemic world and they are absolutely not sustainable as a business model in our current economy if studios think they need theaters to keep their air of legitimacy then they need to subsidize the theaters they absolutely will not survive on their own if they keep going like this
4030,4025,rkan2,blurays are unfortunately actually on their way out  ondemand is too strong for having no logistics too bad the quality is not the same yet anyway
4031,4026,eudofia, nikole good observation the business model of charging  for a bucket popcorn and a drink is not going to survive for the younger generation who are used to streaming content on the phones and tablets the socalled experience of watching a movie in a theater is irrelevant with time movie theaters will become what blockbusters used to be for dvd rentals dead
4032,4027,Angie S,just dont buy them
4033,4028,Zoe Nikole, s  but realistically the concessions being bought is the only way the theaters are able to continue turning a profit were not discussing if i feel ok forking over ten bucks for popcorn were discussing the larger picture of what it means that people arent able to justify this expense to themselves anymore the problem is that if everyone went to the theater and did it the cheapest way possible  matinee showings no concessions  then theaters wouldnt make enough money to stay open they rely on you spending more money on concessions then on the show
4034,4029,Tanay Albuquerque,pandemic was way worse actually shutting down  vs markedly reduced sales
4035,4030,A_fruityMachete,i agree its a family classic custom to go to theaters and enjoy it it just feels special in a way 
4036,4031,Om Dahake,the experience of watching a movie in theatre is like nothing else  i doubt it will ever be replaced
4037,4032,mig189189189,cool video report on your own personal style 
4038,4033,Chris Takeuchi,imagine having seen avengers endgame at home vs at the theaters that was the best movie experiences i ever had
4039,4034,Timothy Marcus,the crowd erupting at cap lifting mjolnir is my favorite cinema experience ever
4040,4035,Brandon M,im very happy to wait until home release rather than go to the cinema
4041,4036,ShinyMooTank,the deals dont matter the pandemic showed us we dont need over priced seats and food brwe can own the movie for the price we pay to go to the theater family of  dont have to spend  to  dollars to watch a movie its  rent or  to ownbra lot of us have better tvs at home than at the movies anyways bryou can pause the movie at home and make a snack or use the restroom without missing anythingbrno people blocking your view with their head and not babies crying brbrtheaters are dead
4042,4037,S M,unless your cinema used some diy projector most people really dont have better tvs than at the movies
4043,4038,Lintang Sinatriyo,most people cant afford a high quality tv
4044,4039,Jerry,watching it at home is convenient but watching it in a theater is an experience
4045,4040,Marlon Rivera,amc theaters are great
4046,4041,Mahdi,amc 
4047,4042,Nick Chan,not surprised when theatres will become a sunset industry
4048,4043,Frank-Gavin Moratalla,i used to go to the movie theater  brtimes a week prior to the pandemic brbut during i stopped going and didnt breven think about stepping foot in a brtheater until dune was released brand then i went to see it twice and brboth times i was very aware of the brfact that i was sitting between two brstrangers and i realized that it would brbe a long time before i was comfortable brenough to return full time if theaters still brexist in a year i do plan on seeing the dune sequel
4049,4044,Blu and Jewel,they said the streaming thing will be over by  and thats next month
4050,4045,A Ranting Culinarian Pastor ,nothing like watching a movie in the theater
4051,4046,Ariel Isaac,i rather go to a movie theater than watch a new movie on a tv the experience is just different amd i just like it
4052,4047,ReRaRd MaN,who else thought that the little squiggly line in the bottom right was a hair for like  seconds in the beginning
4053,4048,Rachel Ilous,i have yet to step foot in a theater since the whole pandemic started 
4054,4049,Crisp,ott
4055,4050,Felipe Valencia,i cant drink a beer while in my underwear  watching dune in the theater check and mate game over
4056,4051,The Grinderman,says who
4057,4052,Fuby TV,when im at home drinking beer in my underwear id rather apply the lipgloss then watch dune
4058,4053,Alpha8713,clearly you are visiting the wrong theatres
4059,4054,Brebeuf Garcia,theaters are a larger social event venue where people can be with people who they dont know yet  that experience you dont normally get in your home where you control everything the promise of the experience of newness and chance are what piques our curiosity and will always drive us to activities beyond the home  theaters are a form of a short vacation
4060,4055,Héctor Bedoya,even things that seem annoying when we go to the movie theater such as people making noises when eating using their cell phones or talking during the movie are part of the experience
4061,4056,Eduard Peeter Lemming,movies are great
4062,4057,Martin Erickson Lapetaje,the giantic screen and emersive sound experice is what makes theaters great
4063,4058,Aiden Tan,are ui kidding me the one thing i miss the most during the pandemic its my friday night movie date with my friends lol
4064,4059,Marcus Carana,answer because some films are worth watching on the big screen with great dramatic audio and theatre have a better ambience of being in a large dark enclosure with comfy seats which increases thequotfeelquot of the movie than simply being in a living room set up or watching a movie in your phone sometimes i wish that some shows were put in theaters because i want to see them on the big screen
4065,4060,skysthe limitvideos,that would be interesting actually imagine if you could go see an episode of game of thrones in theaters every week for a  week season or whatever i dont know if its practical but it would be interesting to watch someone try it
4066,4061,Casper Guo,watched dune on imax and the experience cannot be replicated at home period
4067,4062,VortexH123 ,yep
4068,4063,ghost mall,yeah a theatrical release of like the first season of stranger things would be so dope
4069,4064,Tim Bryan,i think this is a pretty easy and feasible thing to do the theater can announce a showing and heck if theyre really nervous have some sort of minimum number of attendees so big fans will be incentivized to spread the word theres plenty of shows that would be amazing to watching in a theater and theres also tons of movies that many people would want to see again theres also gaming imagine how much fun a community smash brothers event would be on an imax screen at the end of the day movie theaters are just fancy av setups so it shouldnt be hard to find ways to get people to pay to use them
4070,4065,Jamie A, limitvideos my local private theater did show game of thrones at least seasons  and  they tried to get around the rights issue by showing the show for free just making money off concessions it was always packed so i think they got some kind of cease and desist that is why they had to stop it was very cool
4071,4066,staticvoidmain,i used to agree with this especially when i missed watching interstellar in theatres however i watched it again in vr and it completely blew my mind i would say it is a lot more immersive than any imax i have been to that is of course assuming you do have a good computer andor chair to use at home heres the thing its not even as expensive as getting a big tv at home the best thing is no other people to ruin it for me and i can take a break without the anxiety of missing parts of the movie
4072,4067,Tim Bryan, but then the problem is sound a full movie theater sound system will almost always be a better experience than the best headphones although personal bass products like woojer and subpac might help change that however with vr you can lay in bed and have the movie project on the ceiling which is my favorite way of watching movies
4073,4068,Jamo,if you think theaters are obsolete im sad that you never got to see interstellar in one
4074,4069,Alejandro Cabrera,movie theater are perfect date nights i just wish the food wasnt overprices
4075,4070,Napoléon I Bonaparte,i heard that theatre audiences for lotrs st showing was full of emotion cant replicate that at home
4076,4071,Dead_Shoulders,unless you have an audience full of emotion at home
4077,4072,Scott McFarlane,yea i love hearing everyone else in the theatre lol you know why most mainstream fans dropped off fan boys
4078,4073,rkan2,unless you have a proper movie theater at home 
4079,4074,Cunterberg,hail netflix
4080,4075,anurag kataria,resembles  one of netflixs  voir  episodes
4081,4076,Spirus Visuals,i appreciate the choice streaming is nice in a pinch but the experience of going to a theater is unbeatable and superior in basically every way
4082,4077,Xob Driesestig,except for the price and quality of the food the ability to pause and rewind at will and the ability to have some peace and quiet without other people talking and moving while youre watching the movie
4083,4078,Squirrel,great vid
4084,4079,Arlie Bourn1,there is seriously no other feeling that can combat watching a movie on the big screen watching it at home just doesnt feel as immersive
4085,4080,Xob Driesestig,unless the other moviegoers are talkingmoving that really breaks the immersion
4086,4081,Amado Carrillo, driesestig never really had problems like that because i go a few days after the movie hype is down and on a wednesday  pretty much empty lol
4087,4082,Jonathan Rouse,i feel like this is boomer talk theatres will go the way of the dodo in a few years people think they want theatres but the trolls movie proved thats simply not true
4088,4083,Dead_Shoulders, rouse its a dying industry
4089,4084,chaos, rouse i like both if i want to enjoy the movie ill watch it at home if i want to enjoy a memory ill go to theater certified boomer if you will
4090,4085,rkan2,the best is a home theater though  with a projector
4091,4086,kc208, rouse what are you talking about the trolls movie literally came out  weeks in to the shutdown when all theatres were closed
4092,4087,ej ro,speak for yourself
4093,4088,Mad At Gas Car,true
4094,4089,Courtland Hughes, rouse people just dont appreciate quality viewing anymore
4095,4090,Cookiee, rouse not exactly boomer talk im  and watching movies at home just doesnt come close to actually going to a theater even with a widescreen tv and solid audio system
4096,4091,Caldera Gautama, yup laser projector and real dolby atmos are unmatchable for any home theaters especially in my country  film ticket is just about  in weekdays
4097,4092,jabbany,if this is really the case then there should be absolutely no need for an exclusivity window if people really prefer going to the theater to watch it theaters will make profits regardless of whether people can stream
4098,4093,staticvoidmain,not really have you tried watching a movie in vr unless of course youre talking about the experience of kids crying people talking no subtitles no ability to pause and have to run to the toilet and back sticky floors overpriced foods etc
4099,4094,Weichentechnikk, cmon what are you  years old  almost none of that what you wrote happened when i went to see blade runner  in my local imax maybe dont stuff yourself with liter of pepsi then maybe you can sit comfortably for  hours there were subtitles nobody was talking or using phone literally  kids in the theatre could not care less about pausing or food just eat before the movie jeez
4100,4095,Swaroop Rajpurohit, rouse not really come back after  years and youll still see people going to the theatres i dont know about the us but here in asia the tickets are pretty cheap marvel movies are at their best in theatres
4101,4096,Jonna King, rouse im gen x and i want them to stay so does my millenial cousin  i mean dont people go on dates anymore i look forward to my cinema night every week  sometimes you just need to get out of the freakin house
4102,4097,Braindead Person, carrillo nah for me  if a screening is full it gets me more locked into the film if that makes sense idk why but being in a room of hundreds of people most sharing the same love for the movie franchise as you makes me fit in way more
4103,4098,Matthew Walton, king if im quotgetting out of the freakin housequot im going bowling or golfing or camping or skiing watching a movie is something i can do at home and much cheaper and more comfortably as well
4104,4099,TheAnnoyingLemon,amc will moooon
4105,4100,GP_TY,vibes are way better at the theater then watching at home
4106,4101,Reclusive Eagle,
4107,<br>This includes all Anime movies. E.g the Original Dragon ball. Which you could watch in 4K IF they ever digitize it.,,
4108,<br>,,
4109,<br>4K UHD Blu Ray is finally giving decent quality to the consumer. Still can&#39;t beat 35-70mm film though. Just look at Baraka 8k scans,because they have unparalleled quality due to most movies being rendered on actual film as apposed to compressed digital formatsbrthis includes all anime movies eg the original dragon ball which you could watch in k if they ever digitize itbrbrk uhd blu ray is finally giving decent quality to the consumer still cant beat mm film though just look at baraka k scans,
4110,4102,Cyber Trend,no one really cares if its compressed or not just look at the people with netflix subscriptions or the people who watch things on there phone ipad or computer which all have small screens
4111,4103,K, trend they might not care but when it comes to a big film like interstellar thats shot on imax people want to enjoy that feeling in the theatre with the best quality and immersion netflix is often great when rewatching a movie like that
4112,4104,rkan2,absolutely  it is therefore very unfortunate that blurays are actually on their way out to a large extent 
4113,4105,The Grinderman,for me its all about the sound picture quality on my tv at home is perfectly acceptable but the sound system you get in a cinema is a huge part of the experience although the only time ive seen an imax film it was interstellar and the volume was too loud maybe i should just invest in a home surround system
4114,4106,The Last Minute  Trade,they are not dead but most affected by ott especially in pandemicbrbrwhats your opinion on theatre and its future
4115,4107,Ery Almario,i freaking love theatre even though the popcorn is kinda overpriced but streaming is a good option too tbh
4116,4108,N Q H,its
4117,4109,Mighty Nooblet,nothing beats seeing a movie in theaters love my amc a list membership
4118,4110,Erica Gamet,the a list is a killer deal before the pandemic i was using all three movies a week since they restarted the memberships this summer ive only gotten to one movie with hopes to see one this weekend there is nothing like seeing a movie in the theater
4119,4111,Jonathan Pinzon,same here
4120,4112,whoaitsjulie,amc
4121,4113,Left Croc,amc to the moon
4122,4114,Justin Norman,to the moon
4123,4115,1UP VR,because theres nothing like a movie theater
4124,4116,Conor C,am i the only one who noticed they said toy story  released in june st but the timeline is showing the last week in july
4125,4117,It’s not 2019 any more,spidermannnnn
4126,4118,Anthony,blooking at this from the perspective of a scientistb i dont believe movie theaters will not go out of business anytime soon because they are part of the entertainment industry and entertainment is an sector that is recession proof it may be that movie theaters crumble in the future perhaps once we have the technology to directly implant an actors emotions into the viewers brain this is not as far off as you would think probably about    years away cinemas may go extinct due to a better product available on demand 
4127,4119,Jaret Donald Patterson,without watching this video im going to guess the reason is because people love the movie going experience 
4128,4120,Jack Black,thats not why maybe you should watch the video
4129,4121,voice of peace ❤,bi invite everyone to listen to the holy quranb 
4130,4122,katyrebel18,i really like movie theaters but after covid i think that all movies should have a home option for high risk people
4131,4123,K,or you could wait a month after the film releases if every movie did a simultaneous streaming release theyd lose a lot of potential revenue from cinema tickets and cinemas would lose out massively
4132,4124,palopatrol,it already exists its called pirating
4133,4125,N W, just like electric cars are killing combustion engine cars and rideshare is killing the taxi business and cars killed horse and buggy business its called technology progressing
4134,4126,The Grinderman, w your analogy doesnt fit in your examples the general public benefits while specific companies lose whereas the problem with films is that if there is no theatrical release the studio gets less money meaning films are less likely to be funded in the first place the public loses the only highbudget films that would get made would be proven cash cows like marvel and disney films and fast and furious sequels
4135,4127,N W, grinderman yeah but young people today are less communal and spend more time on their phones so imagine millions or even billions logging into netflix to watch the movie on their phones or tv at home thats alot of revenue buddy
4136,4128,Bruno sowaski,yeah
4137,4129,James Donald,sorry if this comes up later but it was missed at the beginning the window for toy story etc was longer because you then had the window for vhsdvd releases before they could be on tv
4138,4130,Charlie Wright,i rather watch at home i dont like wearing face mask  for  hour straight at the cinema
4139,4131,Googlebanmetoomuch 2,meh i prefer watching all content at home on my k hdr tv
4140,4132,Lachlan Trescott,id prefer a mm k imax screen though
4141,4133,Googlebanmetoomuch 2, trescott the human eye can only see up to k
4142,4134,W,its all about the experience sitting in a dark room with popcorn man cmon but at the same time watching the movie at home is cool and all but not the same experience
4143,4135,remedytee,considering the quality of the theaters projector i find the experience to be better at home
4144,4136,Annoyed Dave,vox should report on the animal holocaust the media needs to take an abolitionist stance on nonhuman slavery and stop normalizing evil against animals
4145,4137,Omar Mohamed,what animal holocaust
4146,4138,Pantsmode,bad bait 
4147,4139,Extreme Lube,until movie theaters start selling thc infused gummy bears im never going back

4156,4148,no name,no that was dune
4157,4149,Supkev Gaming,wow  minutes after being published
4158,4150,Arturo Gómez Tagle,maybe theater owners should have stopped gouging people  for  worth of snacks
4159,4151,Otto Phil,you can go  hours without food you know that
4160,4152,Ike Okereke,maybe if movie studios stop gouging theaters you would see snack prices decrease
4161,4153,Andrew Guillermo,they get almost nearly nothing on ticket sells
4162,4154,Cyber Trend, phil doesnt feel the same
4163,4155,Lachlan Trescott,one of the perks living in a rd world country is that movie theaters are not a rip off  for a ticket and  for some mediocre snacks i love it lol
4164,4156,THE DHRUV SHOW, phil well without popcorn i cant sit through a movie 
4165,4157,Apple, trescott you cant count it like that lol the average american earns much more money than the average person on in a third world country bad comparison
4166,4158,Duller,e
4167,4159,Deighton,uh the bass surround sound big screen and most importantly the popcorn im not gonna watch this lol
4168,4160,Lost Marimo, mins late
4169,4161,skylineXpert,i hated waiting a year as a child on the movies i loved to be released on disc
4170,4162,Kate Jagger,the theater by my house actually closed and was up for sale rumor had it a big company had purchased it and was going to turn it into something else well now its back open busy again i hope theaters dont go away watching a movie in a theater is awesome and exciting
4171,4163,Muqe29,exactly people saying watching movie in comfort is best but the thing is that movies in theater is still a far better experience i watched godzilla v kong on hbomax and it felt incomplete theater  near my house when opened finally i saw the movie in theater and the movie felt so much better the action was so good that i felt like i was in hong kong and seeing  gods fight
4172,4164,Ery Almario,its an experience for sure and i dont want it being gone
4173,4165,Het Bol,getting crammed in a small studio with as many people as possible by a greedy corporation while you have to be patient with the waiting time and the loud people is fun oh and you cant press on hold or go back if you missed something did i mention the expensive snacks
4174,4166,Fyn Kozari,i wanna see the data showing how many infections happened in movie theatres im positive they contribute in prolonging the global pandemic
4175,4167,JeelianB B, kozari dont step outside or visit your family it prolongs the global pandemic
4176,4168,Fyn Kozari, b i went outside once this month for a few minutes to buy milk chips noodles snacks usually once per month unless theres something else to do the whole year i probably went outside a total of  times   is coming in  weeks
4177,4169,Mary Rosser, bol there is little cramming there plenty of space in the one i go to the people are typcially not loud and theres no wait time since i can buy tickets online
4178,4170,JustAnotherInternetWiseGuy,i hope so as well although i can say the only good thing about watching a movie at home is that you dont have to sit in those uncomfortable chairs for hours but besides that its not the same without the surround sound wide screen trailers for upcoming movies and the crystal clear film
4179,4171,Fortimus Prime,amen nothing like watching a film on a giant screen with a bunch of strangers and at times family and friends the theater is a special experience
4180,4172,A_fruityMachete,is agree watching in the theaters makes it special in a way
4181,4173,Het Bol, rosser than that cinema isnt fulfilling its purpose earning money as much as possible
4182,4174,sharpestcookieinthetoolbox, you can in fact have all of these things at home theyre just not as cheap as a theater ticket
4183,4175,William Oscar Garvin,youre talking about your theater by your house was closed for sale rumor had is it a big company bought your movie theater are you serious

4218,4210,Darin Campbell,theaters have only suffered because of covid however once we get a better grip on covid movie theaters will start to flourish to some point however theaters are still in a bit of trouble anyways people are streaming more why would i spend a lot of money for a movie ticket expensive price for popcorn hotdogs candy and a large soda when i can watch a movie in the privacy of my home with streaming devices like firestick and nvidia shield why even go to the theater anymore truth is that movie theaters are on their way out also brick and mortar shopping malls are dying out too why go out and shop when i have amazon doesnt make sense to me peace
4219,4211,larry5200,theres was no reason to close them to begin with
4220,4212,Jennifer,i always liked going to the cinema however when people started being rude and noisy i didnt go as much and when the first cinema shooting happened i stopped completely

4238,4230,Juan Shaft Patel,blacks love going to movies
4239,4231,Andrew Oldham,for all the idiots who keep saying theaters deserve to die streaming is the future etc a streaming exclusive future will be terrible the existence of movie theaters is what keeps the prices of home video streaming and pvod low movie theaters go away you will see those prices skyrocketbrbralso remember that two well known movie studios are now owned by telecommunicationsisp giants dont be surprised if in a streaming exclusive future that they start pulling some very consumer unfriendly bullshitbrbrlast but not least there isnt a lot of revenue in streaming so beloved franchises like marvel star wars bond mission impossible fast and the furious wont be made anymore due to not having sufficient revenue to produce them which in turn will discourage the more independent arms of the studios from producing original artsy stuff since blockbuster revenues help pay for thosebrbrso for all the streaming is the future morons it doesnt matter how great your home setup is if there isnt anything quality to stream on it hope you like adam sandlerhappy madisonnetflix original productions or other productions of similar quotqualityquot because that is all you will get in your precious streaming exclusive future and i am saying that as someone who grew up in the s adoring the classic era of adam sandler comedies

4252,4244,MJ Burgess,i live in new york city and i miss going to the movies there is no tv on the market that is bigger than an imax screen so the size alone is a huge factor next watching movies at home is not the same  there are distractions if you live with people  someones phone is going off  noise coming from outside then there is sick and tired of being coopedup in the apartment suppose if you dont need to go to the supermarket or the clothing store or the shoe store where do you go suppose if you dont like going to clubs on a friday or saturday night where do you go since the pandemic started if you want to go out you have to dine at the resturant on the side walk  which is not fun during the wintertime as long as people love movies we will need to go to the movies once in a while
4253,4245,Darryl Catay,yeah  things are tough all over  hotdogs  popcorn  candy  karma is a bitch 
4254,4246,D- Sean,all this for a  survival rate

4256,4248,Phillip Lemmon,i was thinking about theaters just the other daybrnow that theyre shutbrwhat happens to all the foodbrdo they just throw it away or give it away or what
4257,4249,RAY L,going to the movies is a fun not a necessity either or they return to the times of mega productions for less than m and cinemas allow the people to stay and watch the movies over and over until we recover from all this like it happened at the end of the s and then again in the s or promote the tv and internet  industry into a massive movie blockbusters  platform other way we might be facing the fate of cinema hope not
4258,4250,iamjedi006,these businesses must remember it was them who told people no mask no entry fact it was thembrdo they really think i or the normal public wants to sit in a theater half full of people with masks on notbrit isnt my fault they listened to corrupt politicians who they thought would bail them out blame yourselves
4259,4251,iamjedi006,theyre trying to show maskless people brgt when they know full well that the mask police will be there harassing whoever try to get in without one  plz fukoff
4260,4252,Vlastalica Jaime,they are discussing to sit in with human crap and urine found on all the seats and o yeah the countless people on there phones and dont dare tell another person to turn there phone of or be quiet great when i was a kid but as an adult no way in hell would i ever go back
4261,4253,TTV_samplays_23,interacting with people in theaters is part of the experience
4262,4254,Patrick ?,i think that when the american people were forced to stay at home and watch movies at their own space they purchased new tvs and upgraded their existing systems while watching a movie at the theater is a great experience sometimes i think some people have just gotten used  to experiencing films from the comfort of their own home without having to pay the high ticket prices and the absurd refreshment prices
4263,4255,Francine Morris,the movie industry needs to get their tired act together its a crying pitiful painful shame what they tell us is entertainment thank goodness the industry is changing because its formula is expired i predict storytelling and ways to deliver quality viewer experience will improve once that old formula is no longer used
4264,4256,Tori Star,lets be real nobody goes to the movies every weekend by the way
4265,4257,Master Chings Auto Inc.,when this is all over no masks etc i will happily be going every week haha im just going to wait until this is  over then ill go to restaurants and movie theaters again

4301,4293,Charles Kennedy,hollywood did not wast no time in bashing trump and his supporters  hollywood jobs is to entertain not to exercise their political views  piss on them 
4302,4294,Ian Worley,i blame the demorats for all this
4303,4295,Our Real Estate Journey,i used to love going to theaters visits progressively got worse for several reasons a big reason is cellphone use theaters do zero to stop people from using their phones during movies it is beyond distracting and disrespectful to others another reason is cost businesses must increase prices as cost goes up  this is common sense but at what point is it still quotworth itquot its one thing to pay  for  minutes of entertainment but  when itll be available on dvd or streaming within a short period of time however the biggest reason that theaters have vanished from my life is the quality of movies i enjoyed most of the marvel movies as well as several others in the last decade but the sjwpolitical correctness forced into every movie has destroyed all interest in paying to see any of them any more i think a lot of small town theaters will survive simply by being one of the few options for entertainment coupled with showings of classic films from time to time

4310,4302,Deshun Smith,true what i dont understand is why is gyms are open more so than movie theaters it just as bad
4311,4303,Julie Zimmerman,it would be cool if they rebranded the movie going experience especially for the younger generations it would not just be about sitting in the theater eating popcorn watching a long awaited film in addition to that make movie going experience an event have promotional pictures where you can take selfies in front of have the theater decorate and celebrate to the theme of the upcoming hit movie so the movie going experience is not just about watching the movie but being immersed into the theme of the movie kind of like theme park meets moviegoing

4333,4325,rigomortisfxstudios,they are not going to last with streaming movies and with shootings last week no one feels safe going to see thembrstay home and watch a movie in the safety of your home or watch youtube movies for free
4334,4326,cesar,i have a big screen oled tv and sound bar and the picture is great but it still doesnt beat the movie experience its just a different feeling all together i really miss it
4335,4327,Krane,the people here making up comments miss that point why ever go out to eat when you can prepare your food exactly the you want it for  as much and not tipping necessary in fact just say home put rocking chairs on the porch and watch the tree grow
4336,4328,PJ,its not safe being closed up in a space like that with so many people and most arent going to keep their masks on due to eating during the movie  the risk of exposure is very great in a situation like that no matter if they space you out or not theres not enough air circulation to make it safe driveinns are better and safe since your in your car and away from everyone and the air outside is moving and safe so far less risk which is why they are open now vs in door theaters plus with new movies available for streaming people can save money by watching it at home vs paying around  per person with tickets and food when going out
4337,4329,Yanis Agodor,jesus love you he died on the cross for you accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything for god so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal lifequot jn a href you must repent too from that time jesus went about preaching and saying let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near matthew amp

4417,4409,Youngone1534 Young,star cinema in texas has been the only theater chain that im aware of that remained open throughout  with limited numbers allowed per theater of coursehowever i love going to the theater weekly because it supports your local businesses and keeps people employedthere have been a lot of brilliant independent films that have released and no one gives them the credit they deserve for singlehandedly keeping the industry afloatif you wait to see a movie only because its an over hyped big budget film youre missing the real gems that have been releasing in theaters weekly and continue to do so

4426,4418,ZAPSTER,i love movie theaters but this was predicted to happen along time ago
4427,4419,John Boko,not really until covid came along
4428,4420,ZAPSTER, boko george lucas and steven predicted that movies theaters would close and the ones that remain would make their prices premium this was predicted a very long time ago
4429,4421,John Boko, just because george lucas and steven spielberg made a prediction about movie theaters increasing their prices and would be closed  doesnt mean it was  accurate this was cause by a plague not by studios and other distribution media corporations with their streaming businesses their prediction wasnt based around a possible plague
4430,4422,ZAPSTER, boko the plague showed the volatility of the theater market is what im saying
4431,4423,John Boko, the volatility that start to drop due to covid
4432,4424,ZAPSTER, boko hbonetflix and disney plus were always gonna compete with movie releases
4433,4425,John Boko, not really because streaming is whole other medium  they only started to grow thanks to covid before that netflix couldnt even compete with movie theater margins
4434,4426,ZAPSTER, boko the plan was always streaming and you know it
4435,4427,John Boko, the plan was streaming but not to get rid of theaters though theaters are never suppose to go out of business
4436,4428,ZAPSTER, boko thats like saying radio shack or blockbusters when never go out of business
4437,4429,John Boko,  movie theaters are not like radio shack and blockbusters where hollywood and tech corporations need to rely on them to bring in the truckloads of cash
4438,4430,Outlawstar49,ill definitely still go to a theater for an action packed blockbuster movie stream it at home if its anything else just my opinion

4510,4502,Mr. Joshua,i just snuck in my own candy ans bought popcorn
4511,4503,Illi Mai,movie theaters are unnecessary
4512,4504,Josh ryan,so buy amc stock now movies theaters are not going anywhere
4513,4505,j batter Wayne workshop,for the same  to watch it one time just wait till i can buy it stream it as many times as i want on my device their snacks cost a fortune
4514,4506,Krane,streaming isnt free you also have to worry about compression which compromises picture quality and sound
4515,4507,Nathaniel Davis,i for one love movie theaters but they were tripping with the price of snacks and soda smh  i dont miss that but they popcorn is the best
4516,4508,Jordan from Texas,bring a lady with a purse or my personal favorite to use something like a quothealth conditionquot that requires me to carry this bag with epi pens or oxygen or something lol they literally cant search or even question it really my friend uses a camel back water bag with that red and white like healthhospital cross thing no one even approaches him about it
4517,4509,Krane, from texas just so you know movie theaters make their profit on their concessions the price of the movie just pays for operating cost brbrremember they have to pay for the film and hope enough people come in to watch it or they dont even cover their basic costs hollywood indirectly controls the ticket prices through their cost to show the film
4518,4510,Jordan from Texas, exactly right just like you argued above that streaming isnt free you can find an argument for anything soooo i raaaarely go to a movie at the theaters anyway and when i do i like the ones where i can get a meal and personal seating etc where im happy to pay the concession for a decent hot meal as far as streaming vs theaters id pay the price to stream every time for the same reason as above i can have a hot meal in comfortable seatingclothing etc with the added benefit of far superior quality as you state the theater screen is garbage compared to just about any new flat screen of any size today brbri completely understand they have overhead to deal with but as far as im concerned most theaters havent even attempted to keep up with technology or other benefits to justify grossly gouging pricing on the customer you and i both know if youre still using pretty dated screens and seating etc and charging  for a bucket of popcorn that you know damn well costs pennies in bulk or let alone a  candy box thats in the cents bin at walmart  mark up at our cost not the probably  cents or whatever theyre paying buying pallets at a time so youre right absolutely they do have overhead concessions employees power equipment and the list goes on however the theater business has been around as long as the modern world its up to every independent business owner to figure out how to continue to profit as well as bring a quality product to the consumer as far as im concerned most theaters have stood on an old platform refusing to make changes for the consumer and rather just tell the consumer its your duty to keep our platform upright and then want to be surprised when a better option arises and we no longer support you and it crumbles let them fall or let them decide to do the work instead of putting it on the consumer brbri apologize for the run on sentences and possible rant im stuck at home today with my  year old climbing on me and were just having an absolute blast  i hope i dont come off as being hostile or badgering you in anyway i do believe we can both have our opinion and converse the two
4519,4511,Krane, from texas you know you can make those exact same arguments for going to a nightclub a bar a restaurant a concert a ball game or other entertainment or athletic event theres also a cover charge and gratuities to consider in some of those examples brbrwhat about when your two year old is older and wants to go to a theme park do you think your logic will convince himher to stay at home and watch others experience in real life what she can only see on tv  brbras mentioned in the video going to the movies isnt just about the movie but the social experience as for how modern theaters are thats about selection just like anything else for example if you want dolby atmos you have to search for a theater that offers itbrbrone more thing you might want to consider is that filmmaking begins with the theater box office in mind without that paradigm you would lose half the most entertaining films particularly those blockbusters all of us love to watch
4520,4512,Jordan from Texas, like i said you can find an argument in anything what im getting at has nothing to do with cover charge and gratuities i wouldnt spend the money at a nightclub restaurant concert or ball game if i didnt feel it was up to par with the price of the experience exactly why i said i dont have a problem paying money to go to a nicer theater that serves food better screenstech more comfortable atmosphere and seating in general but that isnt the majority of theaters at least where im from there are far more amc and cinemarks etc that have really dropped the ball as far as adding better amenities to justify the price i would hope when my two year old is older he would have the logic to make his own decisions when he see two establishments where you could spend around the same money and enjoy vastly better outcomes from one that puts effort into the consumer rather than the profit margin
4521,4513,j batter Wayne workshop,greed catches up with everyone
4522,4514,Jon Schmidt,new popcorn price will be  to

4525,4517,Ghost Cin,when yall re open maybe yall should charge normal prices for drinks and popcorn
4526,4518,Emo Otaku,amc treats their employees like shit
4527,4519,Jon Does,havent been to the movies in  yearsbrthe liberal fascists of hollyweird havent produced anything worth watching in all that timebrbesides that why would anyone want to pay the high ticket prices ripoff prices for concessions just to watch a lame movie and listen to cell phones ringing
4528,4520,user739,exactly
4529,4521,Cliff Booth,lol its your fault if you dont do research  great flicks are still being made
4530,4522,Ramon Barajas,i built my own home theater for the same price of a nice tv you can buy a projector and screen  never again will i go to a movie theater ill wait for streaming or disc
4531,4523,mantheman mantheman,thats lame
4532,4524,Nick M,amc to the moon  buy monday or you will regret it
4533,4525,Havier Villalobos,billions of dollars and now your crying never saved anything and wants government money let them die off movie theaters a thing of past hbo max showed a movie that released the same day
4534,4526,Jose Robinson,the virus  is here to stay no man or woman can predict what is going to happen and thats the facts 
4535,4527,Hector Garcia,so a coke and popcorn will be 
4536,4528,Andy Chavez,id really rather watch movies at my house anyway
4537,4529,actuallyjacksonw,why
4538,4530,Luis Zelaya, why    use  ur  brainnnn 
4539,4531,actuallyjacksonw, zelaya in my opinion watching movies on a streaming service pales in comparison to the theatre experience
4540,4532,Blue Mist, zelaya going to be less jobs then  get ready for another economic  depression  a domino effect is happening
4541,4533,Mark Bernero,me tooand i can skip the endless ads and trailers before the film
4542,4534,Mark Bernero, foryoutubecomments i totally agree
4543,4535,rigomortisfxstudios,home theater is where its at
4544,4536,Joel Aguilar,when the movies open back upitll mainly be liberals going millions upon millions of people non liberals took note of how all these out of touch liberalwood celebs has been acting this past year  box office revenue will drop significantly couple of reasonsbut the main reasonis because those millions upon millions of people would love to see these out of touch liberal celebs movies tank in the box office they rely on us to give them extra million dollar bonuses so they can continue to  live their lives in their million dollar homes and continue to have one sided liberal voices and cancel or blacklist conservative thinking celebs
4545,4537,Joel Aguilar,liberalwood had practically no voices or concerns for struggling small businesses amongst other issues they chose not to address and stay silent onbut they have no problems attacking  conservative celebs like gina carano no doubt people enjoy seeing their movies flop and lose out on those bonuses they get when they get box office revenue percentages
4546,4538,Jenni,thanks to all of you thumping superior ways conservatives your giving way to those liberals doing what they are doing should have just treated people fair and their wouldnt be this problem
4547,4539,Pulsar1984,i just want new releases i miss movies
4548,4540,Jim26D, foryoutubecomments yeah there hasnt been a movie ive wanted to see in years thats been in the cinema maybe the upcoming french dispatch because wes anderson is a consistent and unique director hollywood has killed the industry with woke trash
4549,4541,Mikey Deloa, aguilar you have a good point
4550,4542,Joel Aguilar, deloa well im glad my point makes sense i try my best to get a rational point on seeing the writing on the wall as far as this topic goes on when they fully open movie theaters yes the altered covid restrictions will be a factor as far as people not wanting to go at all to the new restrictions experiencebut it wont be the only reason why people wont be going to the movies
4551,4543,6bladesroller,got a  inch oled with a sound system please never reopen i much prefer steaming them right to my house and have my cheap popcorn 
4552,4544,26,no they should open for some people you can do in your home if you wanna
4553,4545,Krane,meaningless without content and what do you think drives that content
4554,4546,Shot of Tee & Honey,here here
4555,4547,6bladesroller, profit drives content and if movie theaters continue to not bring in revenue like on demand they will focus their attention on streaming just like they have been for the last year
4556,4548,Fake Bacon,to borrow from a couple of tom cruise films stay quotfar and awayquot from movie theaters or theyll be playing quottapsquot for you
4557,4549,Testosterone Inc. 🇺🇸,cant wait for the theaters to open just so i can watch all the woke garbage movies 
4558,4550,JOEL00111,to tell us how toxic masculinity is
4559,4551,Cliff Booth,too bad you go to theatres to watch woke movies
4560,4552,John Boko, exactly
4561,4553,Testosterone Inc. 🇺🇸, foryoutubecomments someone gets it ill buy you a 
4562,4554,Cheryl Kringelbach,drive inns were so much more fun when i was young and now too
4563,4555,nofknway,yup much easier to get a hummer than in the theatre
4564,4556,Adrian Ramirez,i just hope itll be open on may th for black widow 
4565,4557,Cliff Booth,that movie aint worth watching on the big screen
4566,4558,John Boko,disney might end up releasing it on their streaming service
4567,4559,Adrian Ramirez, boko with raya and mulan being a flop and getting too much controversy from theaters over this strategy like the latest disney vs cinemark situation over rayas release it wont happen since black widow is the movie theaters are begging not to be put on streaming
4568,4560,John Boko, ramirez well it will flop in theaters
4569,4561,PimpTwzt,lol theaters have never been sanitary and clean they have always been gross we just let it slide because nothing bad happened to us after we went to see a movie now people are all paranoid about catching something so no matter how clean and sanitary they try to to get these places there will be a lot of people who wont ever go again and the theaters wont have enough time or money to properly sanitized every seat and screen between showings sadly theaters are on the way out i used to love seeing a big summer blockbuster on a huge screen with loud proper surround sound but now i have a projector at home and surround sound i honestly can live without movie theaters now they have been unnecessary for awhile now they were originally created because it was the only way to watch a show or movie or even get video news then they were still relevant because people had no way to watch a movie at home until the vcr after the vcr theaters became less of a necessity and once projectors and big screen tvs and hd became a thing they really were unnecessary now with streaming added to it there really is no demand for a movie theater we can get everything at home and often times better home projectors actually cost less than a big screen quality tv if you have a big enough room you can have a screen over  inches i watch all my tv and movies on my  inch screen i have for  years now i would still go to see some big movies like avengers and interstellar stuff like that i think imax is still necessary real imax not the fake digital imax or regular movies shown on imax screens there is nothing like real film imax you will never recreate that at home either
4570,4562,Dave Brown,i miss theaters  so much and i know streaming is the future but i miss going with my friends  and discussing the movie afterwards   certain movies were meant to be seen on the big screen
4571,4563,R. Jelly,movie theatres were always too expensive for my family  once streaming came i went that way  i dont regret it  i think i see a movie in a theatre  times a year  i would rather spend my money on activities for our family like the zoo
4572,4564,actuallyjacksonw,i love theatres seeing a movie on streaming services in my opinion pales in comparison to the theatre experience the crowd the way too much popcorn and soda the loud sounds the giant screen it all just is perfect i saw movies  times a month in a theatre before the pandemic
4573,4565,mantheman mantheman,but you have to watch some movies at the theaters man watching movies on netflix is just lame
4574,4566,Cliff Booth,youre a general audience lmao
4575,4567,Naga Min,sadly that cost is due to hollyweird forcing the pricing and gauging them on the ticket and then the theater trying to make payroll with the concessions
4576,4568,Star Bright,ill rather go to the movies
4577,4569,101sanford, bright i feel for ya i feel the same way
4578,4570,Naga Min, foryoutubecomments then they dismal disnip the classic and good stuff into their vaults never to be seen again except for on the  seas or exchangeresale stores
4579,4571,Krane,except people dont go to the zoo every week or even every month besides i did all those things with my school when i took my girls they hated it and we ended up going back to the car by the second paddock every kid likes going to the movies a least i never met any that didnt
4580,4572,Darkshadows123,you say its to expensive yet people pay almost  bucks on streaming services i dont know anyone who just has netflix they usually have disney plus and hulu included or hbo max etc and what do you think is going to happen once theatres are gone they will increase the prices you pay what almost  dollars on streaming services and you go to the theatre maybe  times a year if their are good movies
4581,4573,lothean,what will we do when there are no more theaters  movies are meant to be seen on the big screen
4582,4574,Enigma Seeker,a href coming to d  but its meant for the big screen see my videos to learn more about alita
4583,4575,Sunshine Land,would love to go to a drivein movie never been to one outdoor movies would also be good everyone brings their own mat pillows blanket soda and popcorn
4584,4576,Kara C. A.,driveins are so much fun
4585,4577,Gregory Oliver,youll love it when you can go meaning when theyre open or near you
4586,4578,bangbang9ergang,all because you soy boys are afraid of your own shadow stay home 
4587,4579,Jeff S,wb is releasing all their  movies on hbo max as well as theaters just watched tom amp jerry last night with my son i wish more studios would do the same thing use hbomax netflix amazonprime video hulu etc at least they will get something for their movies because theater ticket sales will stay dismal for a while brive heard of many theaters that are open renting out empty screens to groups of gamers since the number of films available are at a fraction of normal numbers
4588,4580,Ernie Z,drive ins please

4594,4586,JP,i would have to disagree people should have a choice to either stream it from home or go watch it at the theater nothing against movie theaters this is just my opinion

4633,4625,taekorndo,he talks about the interactive experience of going to movies i see it as getting ready having to drive to the theatrelooking for parking people who will talk throughout the whole movie screaming kids overpriced snacks and sticky floors id rather watch movies from the comfort of my own home hopefully when this is all over i hope they keep it where movies are both same day released to streaming and theatre
4634,4626,madmax2069,same here i enjoy movies far more in the comfort of my own home

4639,4631,walker b,adding to itthe movies over the last several years have generally sucked  they all seemed to focus on movies that relied on special effects instead of a good story star wars avengers etc  not my thing  so i quit going a long time ago  good riddance
4640,4632,Eric Royal,you know they own hollywood so why you think movies are gone probably never coming back they dont want us to have any fun if you havent noticed
4641,4633,Who spilled My beans,we should never build huge buildings for this reason all this was wasted

4662,4654,Puromoney 830,dont forget im also going to give you a stimulus check son
4663,4655,Jared Harless,well maybe people are sick tired and fed up with all of the pedophilia going on in hollyweird with these big time hollywood actors
4664,4656,Victor Villagran,he called us animals
4665,4657,Yay Area,its nice to go out and enjoy a movie but being busy and tired you cant beat just relaxing at home in your own theater
4666,4658,Matthew Martinez,is ur screen as big as a theater screen or your sound system
4667,4659,Yay Area,no  just have a sony  inch ag and with a sony htst  k sound bar its good enough for movies away from the theater
4668,4660,Matthew Martinez, area still doesnt sound as good as an imax theater let alone dolby
4669,4661,Yay Area,it is dolby atmos and when i watch movies on apple k its about as close to a movie theater without actually being at the movie theater
4670,4662,Matthew Martinez, area only the top  of the population can afford that
4671,4663,Colton Crockett,of coarse my own home theatre br why didnt i think of that 
4672,4664,doodoodoo 13,its just not as thrilling as actually traveling to a movie theatre in a movie theatre i can actually not only see my own reaction i can see like many other strangers reactions as well so it makes it comforting when theres a funny or crazy moment in the movie when im at home its just sit on the couch lights on because if i put the lights off eyes are gonna be blinded while at the theatre im far enough away from the screen so that it doesnt rlly effect my eyes and then plus the sound speakers everything is just lit
4673,4665,BlueSky,movie theaters will be a thing of the past soon  the malls are dying by the month now    one store after the other has been going out of business the past several years      things dont look very promising for much of anything it seems

4698,4690,Krane,willy  still small see above
4699,4691,Krane, unfortunately your sarcasm fails since its still small in comparison to a movie theater besides movie are as much about sound as they are pictures unless you have dolby atmos to go with that screen
4700,4692,Gregory Oliver,absolutely agree  my most anticipated movie for me
4701,4693,Gregory Oliver,absolutely agree 
4702,4694,J-Willy 413,im definitely going to a theater to watch that movie and buying all the snacks
4703,4695,OddOneOut665,any k tv thats quot is probably gonna be fine to watch it on however its the sound thats gonna be the problem youre gonna need more than just a soundbar for a film like gvk
4704,4696,John Q.,i hope the picture will look great on my k tv

4797,4789,Tom the Man TV,dom how can it be better i am curious about your opinion
4798,4790,Turtle-dom, the man tv well i really havent thought of how someone would do it but with the better sound systems and the better projectors im sure someone could create a wonderful experience and a lot of times the drivein was a place just to have fun i dont know how much of the movies we ever paid attention toas kids with the drinking and kissing and trying to get too close to our girlfriends someone that had the capital could come up with something really good though as far as being topquality now i think
4799,4791,Trae griffin,going to one tonight
4800,4792,rigomortisfxstudios,keep dreaming its not going to happen bro your better off parking your car in your garage and buy a movie projector brand screen there you go your very own drive in parking garage

4802,4794,Mikey Deloa,i much rather go see a good film at the theater but it is a lot more expensive than it was a few years ago for one person a ticket and concessions your looking at twenty dollars at least for a family of three or four and everyone get their fill its a lot of money now prices on everything seems to be going up in the past year alone
4803,4795,Jay Belafonte,they never went anywhere
4804,4796,Jay Belafonte,dom i went to two different drive in twice in  and the experience was bad the sound and most important the screen was un viewable

4847,4839,Libi Uremovic,over  years ago it was predicted that the internet would make movie theaters and block buster stores obsolete  so i was surprised to see investment in movie theaters   personally  im too cheap to pay  or  to watch a movie that i can see for free a few months later 
4848,4840,Quinton miller,you are crazy cheap and missing out there is nothing like the movies your house no matter how big it big your tv is cant touch their sound system screen experience crowd and the reactions the movies will be fine ours just opened and its packed

4853,4845,Darrel Johnson,i agree
4854,4846,Darkshadows123, miller i know the prices are expensive but unless your going every weekend and only going maybe  times a year doesnt make it that expensive and it would the same as going to go out to eat theatres arent the only places that hiked up the prices when me and my husband go to jack in the box we end up paying almost  bucks for food
4855,4847,Quinton miller, saving is worth the experience it can be expensive though the secret is to sneak your own food in lol
4856,4848,Darkshadows123, miller i usually only get a pretzal with a drink or a frap im not a  i have to have  snacks person when i go or like you said sneak in if its candy im lucky my theatre doesnt check purses one time i sneaked in a subway lol

4893,4885,Dwayne Smith,those puns
4894,4886,Zoey Martinez,i really dont feel bad for them they never felt bad for taking my money and under paying their employees 
4895,4887,TEEKA,all facts
4896,4888,Harbor Detail,big facts
4897,4889,tyrone b,yea seeing how things was changing even before pandemic it gonna be hard sale to get traffic back so even if they get where they can max out places again how many are gonna wanna go back to them untill anyone feels safe to do so i only go by chance with fam if can go visit after pandemic is over cause not taking a risk now since lucky got news i was negative for it any
4898,4890,Marco Bodt,come on they dont even make money from any of the movie profits
4899,4891,That One Dude,movie theaters lost their flair after growing up
4900,4892,Marco Bodt, one dude ok weirdo
4901,4893,artenman,now when theatres reopen fully a soda will go from  to 
4902,4894,Amber Winegarden,which will push people to sneak all their snacks and drinks in if they up the pricing on their concessions fingers crossedbrbrit sucks that the drive in theaters were able to keep their profits up including the swap meets that they have over the early days of the weekends
4903,4895,My Chevy SparkEV didn't catch fire,if people are willing to pay they will make it  which will be only worth  in todays money the case the way government is printing money
4904,4896,Deena Price,which is why people will stay comfortable and stay home
4905,4897,Lossii Burns,a bottle of soda in san francisco theaters was already  days so i think your right

4907,4899,James Evans,my wife puts food and drinks in her purse ive brought in full means in tupperware
4908,4900,Epics Seven, burns im not surprised san francisco always has the highest gas prices everything is expensive here

4910,4902,It's Fake Believe,they already have
4911,4903,Dee Cee,years ago we got tired of the concession prices so my wife went down to a thrift store and bought a handbag so big that a bucket of kfc and  drinks will fit into itbrwe call it the moviepursebryou take it from there 
4912,4904,Silent Runner,s fake believe i went to the movies recently they closed down their consession and told us to order on a app ha they missed out on about  dollars from me that day they dont care about money if they arent selling popcorn with a line
4913,4905,Maggie Macias,lol
4914,4906,Tony Hogg,the reason why its so expensive is because theaters have to give the money from tickets sales back to the studio for the first  to  weeks a movie runs  most of their money to run the theater comes from concession sales
4915,4907,rigomortisfxstudios,they will never be the same again they will not last
4916,4908,Krane,lol if anything it would be to their advantage to offer discounts in order to encourage people back into the theaters although its likely to be in the form of ticket sales since concessions are the theaters bread and butter
4917,4909,carreteFILMSPro, evans lol
4918,4910,Sean B.,ill still pay it because i support local businesses

4982,4974,Flaco,more have
4983,4975,Vova Syhin, will die remaining will only survive by charging exuberant prices incurred by covid and due  to the lack of films made theatres are about to become a luxury eperience that will not only make a hole in your wallet but scalpers will also find a way to exploit and profit from this like the ticket resellers of yor as for me ill just get a  inch tv
4984,4976,Dhilip Ram,no chance less
4985,4977,William FangWang,amc to the moon
4986,4978,Pran Pix,watching a movie in theatres is  times better than watching it on tv computer or mobile phone
4987,4979,Jake,small town theaters and small time theaters will mostly die off and the big players will consolidate into either specialty theaters that offer more options or complexes that serve cities of  people
4988,4980,Loy Skee,i will parrot what the actor anthony mackies sentiments were about the age of the movie star is dead and has been for a while a movies gotta sell on the concept before the movie star and usually the concept that sells only appeals to the demographic that rakes in the money which is why were seeing more and more movies with visual effects and rated pg or less you always read how studios get in the way and want to tone things down its because  year olds and china need to see it lol its also a reason why tv is doing better
4989,4981,Kyle Vasser,with k and even k tvs people now get the same quality of movies on a tv at home which is something to consider
4990,4982,Michael Edgerton,i just watched a movie at my local theater for the first time in months i hope movie theaters stay in business
4991,4983,Whiteboyangel,i hope so
4992,4984,Nkosi g,obvisly not you know exactly whats going to happen the second they open up again
4993,4985,MOD1T,i have been wondering if some actors a list actors we might find begin to join with some of the higher end idie directors etc funding them to make blockbusters for a cut cinemas the big chains if they went under maybe would leave an opening opportunity for some smaller goups to buy them it would make the sector more competative and more creative again less of the budget and cgi more acting and more quality as you discussed i would like to see some other none elite firms go into the big films kind of neil bloumkompf went from the indie hit district  to elysium and chappie instead of sony or universal or mgm funding them why not the actors fund it partnering for a revenue cut at the end
4994,4986,Nathan -,i really hope theaters dont go out of business not everyone wants to stay home all day on their tv or shop online i even heard certain stores are shutting down and going strictly to online were all gonna be zombies staying at home on our coaches if online stuff keeps happening
4995,4987,hemanth kumar,netflix is enough for now dont have time to spend in travelling waiting for movie to start etc 
4996,4988,Bluelight Studios,it wont be a necessity like how it used to be but i would see it more as a luxury choice likebryou go there just to enjoy the experience because its way more formal existing and coolerbrto watch it on the big screen tv with so many people and its like how people today still choosebrto buy the classic alarm clock thats analog and has the two bells on top that rings when its time peoplebrwould want the experience the classic way due to how cool it is and to be honest watching a new moviebrin the cinemas with popcorn drinks and snacks is way more pleasant and comforting rather then watchingbrit on your phone whilst sitting on the toilet its convenient but it takes the whole joy away from it
4997,4989,D A,no more sold out blockbusters  
4998,4990,Illi Mai,buh bye theatres aint gonna miss ya
4999,4991,RedBison,the experience economy will bring them back in some form i think the resurgence of drive in theatres is an example of this the more you dont need to leave your home for anything the more you will want to leave your house
5000,4992,breakingben 95,i hope not 
5001,4993,Sharx,theyre gonna have to adapt im hoping they lean on having movies that people actually want to see in the definitive format not just the newest stuff maybe instead of showing every lame new horror movie for the month after it comes out they can show a rotating selection of alltime favorites imagine going to the theater and getting to choose between jurassic park star wars and lotr maybe im just weird but thatd be a huge pull for me
5002,4994,TheDoltonboy,face it they are going away   youre going to support an entire industry on superhero movies  i dont think so
5003,4995,KD Dollaz,we dont need them too
5004,4996,Josh Loves Movies,no movie theaters are not gonna go extinct we survived a pandemic we can survive another one and  is stock full of blockbusters to entice moviegoers to feel safe and return
5005,4997,Drex,uh no this great reset is not going away until everything is reset
5006,4998,Josh Loves Movies, not everything is gonna reset its gonna take some time go everything but we will recover
5007,4999,SanAntonioian17,if movie theaters go extinct thatd be an crushing blow for everybody but i doubt that its going to happen watching movies at home is cool but going to a movie theater is different
5008,5000,Drex,they are going extinct will be many many yearsa decade at least until any kind of chainunless its in asia makes a return and they wont be as successful or big as they used to be
5009,5001,Nœrdy Thugg,i feel quotlikequot i heard the word like more than enough for the rest of my life
5010,5002,TheSilent Knight,i watched tenet amp the new mutants in september and that was it they cancelled everything else planned in november groovy
5011,5003,Alan Arzate,you dont have worry about movie theaters going extinct when you have ur movie theater at home
5012,5004,GameStation3,not everyone can afford high end picture and sound
5013,5005,CanadianDNA,i could be wrong but i feel like movie theaters will become like blockbuster theyll survive but with half or less than half of as many location
5014,5006,Almerindo Naval,thats a silly question
5015,5007,unfair sanic,lolz i dont have to worry about that i just need to go outside of us where theaters  are everywhere
5016,5008,Natty,wouldnt mind seeing black widow at imax though tbh
5017,5009,Natty,cant see myself going again
5018,5010,Jasonsmith1998,save broadway theaters
5019,5011,Brandon,what if movie theaters like amc streamed their blockbusters like do both in person for the big screen experience and online for the ones too lazy to drive
5020,5012,The Judge,movie theaters will never close i think if anything driveins will resurface
5021,5013,Alberto Castillo,last year i went to the movies at least once a week i miss it so much im not from usa though
5022,5014,emrah şimşek,before there where no covid  i used to go to the cinemas a lot those days where fun i mean it if i had the chance i will destroy all coronavirus and no more coronavirus gone forever
5023,5015,Elita A,movie theaters were already on some  kind of extinction process way before  covid so i dont know the ice is  very thinbrin germany i read that the average citizen was  times  per  year per year and  that without the statistics is something i clearly noticed way before covid me  as a  huge  cinema fan that i am used to be there at least times per month and  it  was mostly just  me  alone or  a hand full of people there while year  by  year the  cinema  was  looking dirtier and forgotten
5024,5016,gongolong,once the election is over they will come back slowly
5025,5017,Chris D,i think they will go the way of drive ins they will still exist but will be hard to find
5026,5018,TheRealFella,yesno
5027,5019,Eddy M,what thats insane and crazy talk 
5028,5020,Dignus Dingus,i sure as bloody hope not
5029,5021,Alex Acosta,maybe drivein movies will be a thing again
5030,5022,ZevZero,in my state they are all still closed due to covid right now i wouldnt go back till its safe i do agree converting them to a drive in would be cool
5031,5023,M Jerome,when ww comes out i will buy tickets to go to the premiere i am confident my local movie theatre will organize a cosplay party or a injustice  tournament or give me free sandwiches and posters after screening the st movie to build the hype and when i seat in front of that building tall movie screen i will get the feeling again that it surpasses the  inches display that i have in my living room
5032,5024,i forgot the name.,they wont go in near future but ppl are getting so lazy that it is a possibility
5033,5025,RedEyes,maybe there prices will come down that would be nice
5034,5026,Ajay Maisuria,i dont think the question should be about the appetite of audiences but more about if cinema chains can afford to stay closed and be heavily in debt a lot of cinema chains rely on concessions and with the economy as well as safety i doubt audiences will fork out as much
5035,5027,permeus,extinct no but they will need to change this was coming even before the virus the cinema will become less about the latest blockbuster and all about the experience if they dont evolve then yes they will become extinctbrbrthey will need to focus less on cramming as many people into a small room to watch the latest thing and start to be about comfy seats with plenty of room in them fresh hot food that kind of thingbrbrmaybe doing events like halloween marathons for all hallows eve where they show blocks of old black and white films and next door its the slasher block
5036,5028,MATT R,no due to piracy
5037,5029,Paul,if all they show are blockbusters what do they fill the rest of their screensschedule with their rent is the same whether they operate every screen all the time or just a few screens for a few hours a day even if production companies made more blockbusters for theaters to create quotexperiencesquot the increased supply might outpace audience demand
5038,5030,Anon Pelmore,literally my least movie in theatre was endgame
5039,5031,Betel Juise,ive never went to a theatre in my whole life lol
5040,5032,Jonna King,congrats you win zoomer of the year  now tell me you have no idea how a landline phone works with all those little buttons and the quothookquot thingy that you put that big headed thingamabob on  and you win zoomer of the decade

5056,5048,jerryhotwheels,digital movies
5057,5049,Kevin Sheppard,one thing i think is going to change is the theatrical exclusivity window expect to see movies on digital a lot sooner even while theyre still on at theaters
5058,5050,Runner,cinemas are dead even if coronavirus ends weve learnt so much about droplets people wont want to  be stuck in a room with peoples disgusting aerosolized droplets around them
5059,5051,Derek Kirk,movie theaters really just arent trying like no one is stopping amc from throwing up a big white sheet and having a drive in experience like every friday they have the parking space like why not
5060,5052,David Sprague [DragonMan64],i sincerely hope not how else will i get the ideal experience when seeing movies like dragon ball super broly or avengers endgame
5061,5053,Shaurya Kumar Gautam,are movie theatres going extinct yes they are going through a very tough time and you can blame covid for that brbri saved you some time
5062,5054,C P,cineplex is going out of business google for how much debt they have

5064,5056,☁POPULATION-_-420🌿,but wat about a quiet place part  
5065,5057,kill3rs,hard to feel sad about this when everytime i go theres always a distraction and annoying people
5066,5058,Oliver Queen,the return of the drivein
5067,5059,M Franchize,of course not numb nutz we are in a pandemic 
5068,5060,Ohimark,even if movie theatres go extinct the legacy of the theatre will go on forever
5069,5061,velociraptor4you,this actually gives me hope 
5070,5062,Nekminute,they allready became extinct the moment i got a quot oled
5071,5063,Valk-Kilmer,fellow oled owner here  movie theater picture quality at least here in the uk is absolute garbage even so called k imax releases
5072,5064,Patrick Lange,if they do say goodbye to big budget films
5073,5065,Justin,stay home and prevent the spread of covid  end of story no wonder america is screwed lmao 
5074,5066,BannedOnTV,movie theaters have been my escape the last few years and i just dont get the joy watching movies from home like i do in the theaters
5075,5067,OwiBones,same man the hype of watching a highly anticipated movie in a packed theatre is just amazing watching it at home just isnt the same
5076,5068,The Newbee Dev,yes
5077,5069,Francois Zaldivar,depends of the movie summer movie only the tops one
5078,5070,Kynon Ardoin II,there should be a law passed to protect them
5079,5071,solterohugo,i hope not i love going to the movies 
5080,5072,MtnD0,seriously doubt theyll go outbrpeople crave the raving sensation of the audience whether its to hear the chants and cheers or to be there in the sadder momentsbrbrits an experience that no one wants to go away there are people who would rather be alone and thats okbrbut to be there as a whole with the audience that is something everyone wants to be apart ofbrbrit just hits x better when you know everyone is in sync with what they are seeing on screenbryou feel apart of something big and its hella fun knowing people youll possibly never meet again are in unison with their thoughts in that single moment
5081,5073,Steady Cuzzin,bis that jimmy fallon in disguiseb
5082,5074,King David,why not open the drive in movie theaters again
5083,5075,Epyonwings,no wont let it
5084,5076,James Wanku,i hope not i mean where else am i supposed to throw popcorn  lanes down and blame the guy next to me
5085,5077,Jeremy Thelen,you keep saying you will only go to see a blockbuster yet i keep thinking about going to an old blockbuster dvd store
5086,5078,Omega Anubis,thats  a guarantee  ive literally seen  of the movies that have come out in the past  years i do theatre patron censuses for all of toronto gta movie theaters and with the exception of the odd blockbuster  the seats are  empty on average  toronto is the th largest city in north america  million not sure how other major cities are stacking up but its sad 
5087,5079,Justin W,just send all the future movies to hbo max
5088,5080,shadowplay95 ___,bro were still in a pandemic
5089,5081,Vicarious Gamer,i do hope that they make a come back eventually i didnt frequent them much but sometimes depending upon the film theres nothing like that gigantic screen just throwing stuff at your face at least i have the fond teenage memories of gathering with my friends to watch a midnight movie this i do miss
5090,5082,padraic,i think in the future there will be less movie theaters but they will be larger and the ticket price will go up considerably  but imagine a screen x the size of the largest imax
5091,5083,Oh Aww Geez,they should drop ticket prices for a few years to incentivize going
5092,5084,Sweater Day,it is possible to not start out every video by telling people how shitty this year has been maybe spread some positivity and up your journalistic jargon a bit
5093,5085,TonyGMichael,disney amp warner will open their own theaters amp charge other studios
5094,5086,Shane Lambert,i went to go see akira in k at imax a week ago it was freaking amazing and guess what there were only like  people in the whole theater lol
5095,5087,Lew84,i want to see drive in movie theaters make a big come back now
5096,5088,Troy Andrew,no they wont
5097,5089,Rudie Obias,theres going to be an economic after the pandemic movie theaters restaurants bars clubs are going to survive and will probably be tough to get into i bet were going to see movie overperform postpandemic too
5098,5090,luciano Baptista,what the heck is this guy talking about
5099,5091,SM Dubs & more,i vote for drivein movies to avoid spreading covidbrevery cinema has a parking or they could find a way idk
5100,5092,Target 2001,tbh they are over priced so rather just stay home
5101,5093,Ramah Jones,movie theaters should become more specialized and more willing to show multiple formats in more locations ie more imax  mm more incentive to push those black and white formats a la logan
5102,5094,jt hardie,well i dont know i was thinking they would convert into arcades but thats silly it would be practical to assume a hotel like resort for customers when this pandemic is recalled
5103,5095,Thomas Casillo,i hope not even if they aint at full capacity for a while id still like to get out of the house and go to them
5104,5096,Matthew Hernandez,i just want to watch demon slayer mugen train in the theaters next year
5105,5097,Twistedwirestudios,my local theater just went out of business 
5106,5098,ITMeCE,i hope not i love them very much
5107,5099,Torbs Knut,bring back drive in theaters
5108,5100,ShockTheMaven,i would hope not its probably my biggest hobby i love going to movie theaters
5109,5101,Craig Wainwright,two words drive in
5110,5102,cooldude333,yes they arebrbrthey were slowly dying before but the pandemic kicked everything into high gearbrbrnow the theaters who deliver an experience for example alamo drafthouse or imax they will carve out a niche audiencebrbrbut the regular multiplex theater concept thats gone  its outmoded and its never coming back
5111,5103,Forward Slash,i can see a lot of small cinemas going but can see others trive selling the cinema experience
5112,5104,Truth Truth,when you can stream everything thats whats gonna happen
5113,5105,Ben Sweeney,disney somewhere is doing drive in movies but i wouldnt want to go to a movie while wearing a mask for hours while social distancing with everyone around me id rather get a better quality tv comfy chairs and stream whatever comes out  if i had a car id do drive in movies
5114,5106,Jack .Stravinsky,and drivein theaters will make a comeback
5115,5107,Under The Microscope,i hope they go away we would be better off without them
5116,5108,Zil,netflix is the future
5117,5109,Jake Stumbaugh,vaccines dont work period
5118,5110,Unbox Gamer,i cant imagine a world without theaters  i probably wouldnt watch most of the movies 
5119,5111,Tremori,covid gives great chance to reimagine what it means to go to the theatre in a new age i think i needs to go from cheap popcorn to a truly unique experience maybe movies have home releases at the same time now but theatres can provide a take my money kind of experience instead better food better seats smaller audiences in movie ordering
5120,5112,sickcarnagerequiem,no theres nothing quite like watching a brand new movie on a giant screen with the most impressive surround sound that most people would never afford
5121,5113,JB S,quotlikequot x
5122,5114,Spencer E,no due to the fact that they are rereleasing movies
5123,5115,Erlaxis,thay are open in my area went to watch tenet last sunday
5124,5116,Master Sasori,if you go to movie theaters you will get infected
5125,5117,King Vegeta215,with what covid fairy dust
5126,5118,El Chancho,honestly it wouldnt bother me if they closed down bri watch most movies off of pirate sites these days and see  movies a year in theaters
5127,5119,Pikachu,the experience of going to the cinema is half the reason most people go you just dont get the same experience at home
5128,5120,GameBlast,
5129,5121,Magoo,you could say the same for sports but that aint going anywhere
5130,5122,N,depends on the movie
5131,5123,Sanek94cool,truebrim getting better experience at home
5132,5124,N, sherancheering at home and at the stadium isnt the same
5133,5125,N, sheran i merely responded to your response to klark griswold dont understand why youre so upset
5134,5126,TheRockyCrowe, this the enormous screen and surround sound the feeling of excitement from you friends so or family as you sit down with your heavenly delicious overpriced popcorn in anticipation of the film the shared reactions of the audience brbrit just does not feel the same at home the entire atmosphere is different and thats coming from someone who has a kickass home theatre system
5135,5127,irwan dianto,many years ago people said the same thing about newspaper
5136,5128,N, dianto what
5137,5129,Kevin Castillo, dianto  newspaper still alive and better than digital no tv can replicate the theater experience and no digital news can replace the feeling of a newspapernothing can replicate an experience or tangible thingsbrbrinteraction will always be needed in our reality something tech has damaged greatly thats why depression is on the rise in younger people
5138,5130,N, castillo lol grandpa
5139,5131,Kevin Castillo, youll notice eventually
5140,5132,N, castillo doubt it
5141,5133,Sanek94cool, castillo ah yes not because education is broken medicine is wasteful and lots of people struggle to find a jobbrbut of course it is all fault of tech
5142,5134,Kevin Castillo, if you dont notice how tech has changed social interaction maybe i should say its a double edged sword i mean look at us
5143,5135,Jonna King, then have it zoomer but leave my movie nights at the theater alone leave it to zoomers to mess it up bc quotwhats the point of leaving the house when you can watch it on your iphonequot
5144,5136,The Best Outta 2-1-5,cinema sins  ripped up uncut gems
5145,5137,Skull_boi,i really wish they dont go away watching movies at the theater has a different feel to which i like
5146,5138,Nameplayer,are driveins about to get a reboot
5147,5139,Poever,i dont wanna lose movie theaters ill commit suicide if we were to lose theaters and the theater experience
5148,5140,Bio21,movie theaters are straight up my favorite place i really hope they dont go away
5149,5141,The Masterpiece,oh no
5150,5142,jameson,nothing else i repeat nothing else will compare to the movie theater experience
5151,5143,Dialéctica,what isnt mentioned here is the fact that theaters were already in trouble before the pandemic they were already on the verge of going broke because distributers keep most of the ticket sale and they have to survive with popcorn and snack sales which isnt as much as youd think considering costs they require to keep them open bra very optimistic conversation but if theaters only open for three or four huge blockbusters a year that wont be enough to keep them alive unless studios end up buying the theaters chains and thats unlikely brthis will probably be the last nail in the coffin for a business that was already on its way out
5152,5144,Hyprotoons Productions,why dont netflix prime hulu buy some theaters and capitalize on imax and d formated movies experiences i think people still like to socialize and get out the house make the movies affordable and interactive movie theaters shouldnt go extinct but revamped into something more entertaining
5153,5145,Daniel Diaz,if it does disney definitely buying amc or regal
5154,5146,WhatsHappening783402,they were doing fine until the coronavirus
5155,5147,NinjaNick Gaming,quotlikequot
5156,5148,Christian Vargas,the future open space cinema
5157,5149,Ross Stewart,i think they will in the uk things are different in the us  we find it so weird when you shout and cheer at theatres there it doesnt happen here and we are a bit more introverted
5158,5150,usa kira,date night will never let movie theaters die
5159,5151,SectionEight,probably if covid remains a present danger globally in the future
5160,5152,Emilio Perez,if gamestop doesnt die first then movie theaters will
5161,5153,Shane Harrington,short answer no
5162,5154,willinton06,yes they have to its just the way things are
5163,5155,Ben Grimmerson,then where am i gunnu watch the next james bond flick
5164,5156,Jake Barrett,i hope not ill go crazy and upset if they do i know people love going to see their favorite movies like mcu disney star wars and everything else
5165,5157,Profound815,imagine instead of renegotiating terms and agreements with movie studios based on shifting market or offering more value to the customer experience to encourage repeat visits amc buys out kerasotes and most competition overcharges concessions price gouges the loyal audience with increasingly worsening stub rewards and then acts surprised realistically speaking covid only quickened the end of the theaters the theaters backed themselves into a corner and made the audience upset at the wrong people now digital media will dominate why give a theater a movie for a month for  profit when you can sellrent it out and keep 
5166,5158,Pickle A.K.A Pickle Rick's Fatass Cousin,nah theyll still be aroundbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrin your house
5167,5159,LegendaryGamer,nobody understood how the spanish flu operated that means people still went out and lived there life no way movies are going to recover movie theater make money off concessions not ticket sales if you only have a small number of folks in the seat and most are scared to buy any food as they cower in fear wearing their mask
5168,5160,Luciana Garcia,i think not
5169,5161,Banook!,that pod wont be sterile for long
5170,5162,Trap Senseii,i hope not theres something about watching a new movie in a theater with giant surround sounds and that giant screen it just hits different 
5171,5163,The Movie Critic,i saw tenet a few days ago and i was like quotoh my goodness i missed you so much imax and theaters
5172,5164,Paul,do they still let you eat and drink during the movie i imagine something serious like tenet is fine but im not sure i want to be putting popcorn in my mouth while the guy next to me is snorting soda out of his nose laughing
5173,5165,The Movie Critic, when i went there was only one other person in there in the theater some rows were marked off with caution tape because of the pandemic i had got some popcorn and a drink and watched the film
5174,5166,miguel martinez,i went to watch tenant there was only  peopel in the whole auditorium me my bro and my bro in law it was odd but cool
5175,5167,The Movie Critic, martinez before the movie started i was looking behind me and stuff because i was paranoid and i watched too many scary movies 
5176,5168,Spr0cter,why does everyone act like the pandemic is going to last forever
5177,5169,Ed D,because its the same kind of virus as the cold but turned up to   theres not going to be a vaccine
5178,5170,Spr0cter,then lets all go back to normal and call it a day
5179,5171,klara Petrijevčanin, d turned up to to  wow you really ate up all those lies huh
5180,5172,Ed D, petrijevanin i have family and friends that are doctors that are still freaked out by it  ill believe a health professional over a politician
5181,5173,Marc Cisneros,sure feels like forever
5182,5174,gamer480, d its a normal virus a bit more stronger then the feverbrdont make it bigger then what it is
5183,5175,CHARLIE DUBB,bring driveins back and ive always preferred watching movies in my own home theater setup i hate crowded movie theaters
5184,5176,Darth Derp,thats how technology is with online being a thing now to the point that it killed blockbusters if people still remember
5185,5177,C Borazo,thats very very different blockbuster was movies on dvd after they were already in theaters  months prior not premiering for the first time ever on a giant screen
5186,5178,Avalanche 616,i hope movie theaters go away brnever liked the quotexperiencequot of screaming kids people talking through the movie no ability to pause and the scheming behind the industry on how they doctor the numbers to prove they had a loss  and a blockbuster at the same time
5187,5179,DemiTrusdale3,now if only something can be done about gamestop
5188,5180,DRKMichael,i mean its experience not something you can create somewhere else that easilybrbrbtw please say they wont i love my job there
5189,5181,michael S,theres gnna be more direct  to consumers at home les at big screen in my area were lucky  to have  drive in theaters  in a  mile range witch have been booming
5190,5182,juniorgod321,i think so pirate bay will be the way of the future
5191,5183,PlatinumState,theyll be back to normal one day for sure even if the current ones go bankrupt and disappear some other company will open new theatres since people like going to the movies and theres money to be made
5192,5184,Wolfespaz,drive in theaters will probably make a comeback especially if they bring the prices back down to sensible amounts theater prices are out of control really 
5193,5185,George Foreman,movies will be dead by 
5194,5186,Miguel Garcia,movie theaters will still be around but there will be less of them
5195,5187,Shaine Montgomery,the biggest thing that would help this industry would be for the movie theaters make more of the cut of the ticket which right now they make a small fraction of and they really on that  dollar popcorn
5196,5188,Hail Cipher,the problem is the price is high and well corona this year
5197,5189,whatsuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,no they will be either bailed out or bought  up by other companies
5198,5190,Elibbb1111,this cause a lot of people hunt theaters down the goverment need to set tham free to the wild
5199,5191,Mulligan,barely closed here in nsw most are open again if not all
5200,5192,Dante Toshiro64,probably dont know when thobrbrbrbrbri mean bblockbustersb went extinct so yeah
5201,5193,Andman8210,i hope not but it seems the market is going that way
5202,5194,JN,movie theaters going extinct if covid never happened you guys wouldnt even be making this video to begin with
5203,5195,Leigh Sherval,no if theyre open people will go
5204,5196,Mike,new drinking game take a shot everytime calabro says quotlikequot
5205,5197,87swoosh,i would be hammered drunk in  sec
5206,5198,Brandon Naidoo,like im glad like im not the only one like who noticed this like
5207,5199,Tahsin Bashar,i tried and now im walking on the surface of the sun
5208,5200,87swoosh, bashar  lmaooooo
5209,5201,DareDevil,like thousands times or like   idk brlike that much like
5210,5202,R0bbathehutt,vod is the future
5211,5203,Mirsha rulez,i think business will go down but next year when movies like fast  black widow etc come out people wont mind risking catching coronavirus to see it movie theaters will do the impossible to keep theaters cleaner than ever by disaffecting everything every few minutes
5212,5204,Harrison Littrell,i am hoping and praying that movie theaters wont go extinct
5213,5205,P4L,ill cry if it actually happens
5214,5206,Gromski,i work at a regal and well we got put on hold again as theatres closed down again
5215,5207,TheWorld,theaters have little value anymore steaming services are bigger and offer companies a bigger cut as well as giving consumers more convenience most people would rather relax at home on their bed with cheap popcorn than be stuck in uncomfortable seats eating the same cheap popcorn that they had to buy a kidney for theaters arent really needed anymore
5216,5208,Nether Freak Ultima,hopefully they wont closebrbrthe pandemic has to end sometime soon right
5217,5209,Thewitcher85,not soon
5218,5210,Nether Freak Ultima, hopefully they wont close either way
5219,5211,jrod kroy,honestly max do you ever not talk about avatar
5220,5212,I Komang Ari Putra,its inevitable
5221,5213,Eltener123,i hope so artificially holding movies from home release is so annoying i dont want to have to listen to morons talking and crunching on popcorn in an uncomfortable seat when id rather just watch a movie with friends at home on the sofa not to mention the shitty audio quality and how terrible movies at the same rez look on a screen that big
5222,5214,The Nintendo Gamer,i think this situation is actually very similar to physical video games brbrthey wont ever go away but they wont be the normal format to see a new movie
5223,5215,S.ns.,eventually of course definitely but for now i think theyll stay around for a few more years
5224,5216,Martin Valencia,its like closing down all the gamestops thats wrong and not right
5225,5217,Roberto Hidalgo,that is kind of different you dont play the games in gamestop you go to the cinema for the big screen quality audio things you can recreate on your home i guess some people can but not all people can afford that
5226,5218,Martin Valencia, hidalgo yeah thats true my bad
5227,5219,Lit Dymax,no love theaters dont want them to be closed
5228,5220,Masilya111,yes obviously s
5229,5221,Aliquid Gaming,drive insjust lets do drive ins again
5230,5222,Battle Rifle,they are sadly i used to work for one my close friends who work there been saying constantly that were no customers coming in they were only getting like  customers a day which is sadbrbrthey worked at a regal so it closed down i think they are going bankrupt
5231,5223,Omega Anubis,same here in toronto  canada i predict theaters dying out in less than  years
5232,5224,Blair,is this before or after corona
5233,5225,shepherdb0y,that clip added at the end of watching a movie at amc is similar to how i see it the smaller momamppop theatres will fade away but the big businesses like amc or cinemark will expand to not only viewing a movie but having a meal and a whole experience while watching the movie and its like he said only blockbusters will be in theatres from now on prices will probably go up based on the experience chosen but seeing a movie in a theatre will be more of a treat than ever almost like going to see a broadway play
5234,5226,ArchThaBoss,i went to go see tenet yesterday in imax popcorn and soda was like  i asked the lady did she make a mistake lol
5235,5227,Kalob&Alexis Brown,nooooo we need godzilla vs kong and jurassic world  in theaters ive seen every jurassic film in the theaters
5236,5228,cha5,i hope not id really miss our local alamo drafthouse theatre in austin tx
5237,5229,Ryan Muller,my cinemas arent going to shut down theyre playnigamazing old movies lotr et jurrassic park etc
5238,5230,DarthRaider,movie theaters make boat loads of money  theyre not going away
5239,5231,Jason King 1381From BKNY,honestly one of my fears outside of my familys safety of course and that of others is the fear well never go back to our normal way of life movie theaters and going out to eat and family gatherings so on are like a fantasy we all shared and now we are awake and we just want to dream again but whats most important is we are all safe and we can put this pandemic behind us already hopefully sooner rather than later 
5240,5232,GhettoMist,normal isnt normal anymore sad to say i think overtime people will leave their homes less and less
5241,5233,Steve Collyer,people in power will never let that happen
5242,5234,icymoe1024,movie theaters are done   sitting in a room with  strangers is a hard pass for me   and i am a amc movie pass member
5243,5235,SeanIveroni,its not gonna be  plus anymore 
5244,5236,icymoe1024, you right   i most certainly wont be there   nor will my family
5245,5237,SeanIveroni, well me and my wife went and it was very organized but i understand bro
5246,5238,Jogs Martinez,remember when everyone went crazy on the last assemble in endgame in the theater damn that was an experience
5247,5239,jameson,perfect example of why the movie theater experience is none like any other
5248,5240,Nipachuuu,endgame on opening day was so fun people in the theater were so excited
5249,5241,Demigod J,experiences like that are the reason i love going to movie theaters
5250,5242,Philip Banks,ill never forget it  my favorite theater experience of all time
5251,5243,Natty,really in sweden everyone sits still and shuts up you know like at concerts 
5252,5244,books from Windblown,if your young like teens and in s then that will be with you for a long time
5253,5245,danverss,watching it first time on your laptop just doesnt feel the same at all
5254,5246,Martin Valencia,hope tha movie theaters get people to go back i rather go to the movies then sit at home stream this and that
5255,5247,TheGumballScrub,shits too expensive quottheater glamorquot does nothing for me regal and cineworld threw in the towel yeahpretty much over and this pandemic aint even hit a year yet
5256,5248,bigmike4758,one way or another i will be seeing jurassic world  in 
5257,5249,cookieman,hope not its one of the things i truly enjoy doing
5258,5250,Tom,drive ins already are unfortunately

5260,5252,TITANMAN251,uh oh
5261,5253,Trenpire,the only people that still go to movie theaters are boomers
5262,5254,SeanIveroni,wrong lol theaters are best
5263,5255,TLCompletionist,no but i hope that the option to watch new movies from home becomes much more of a choice
5264,5256,Indie Cinemaster,please at least leave driveins
5265,5257,Marc Levy,theyll be back different but back
5266,5258,Martin Valencia,hope nothing happens to the movie theatres 
5267,5259,random panda on the internet,what do you mean by theaters going extinct they already are
5268,5260,Destructus 86,even before covid i only went a couple times a year mainly for marvel or dc or star wars everything else i rent on vod   theaters are going to have to change
5269,5261,Cameron McElroy,nah i dont think so
5270,5262,Haru,i think this is the most on point philosophical concept ive ever heard this year
5271,5263,GAME_ THEORY,i think you dont know what philosophical means
5272,5264,ScoobySnax,nooooooo i love the movies
5273,5265,Tony Lopez,hopefully they open soon i want to see the new saw movie and halloween
5274,5266,Spider-Man,im pretty sure movie theatres will be fine
5275,5267,Van, guitars and gore drive ins were dropped because it was very difficult to maintain the screen and systems obviously as soundproofing material better speakers and d became a thing that could not be replicated in drive ins the same thing that drive ins could provide could be provided by theaters but its not the same if u watch a movie on your laptop and not everyone could afford home theater systems so theaters are the best way to experience movies unless home theater systems become super affordable
5276,5268,JONATHAN SANDERS,i hope youre right
5277,5269,Beastmode650, guitars and gore the westwind drive in out here in san jose ca is always packed
5278,5270,Super,no
5279,5271,Chunchunmaru,no
5280,5272,Mejy,if movie theaters go extinct im going to be so sad
5281,5273,Woke Andy,im not less infections and less mass shootings its a winwin imo
5282,5274,Victor Zhargalov,why
5283,5275,Justin Kwiatkowski, andy i think there would be more mass shootings because a lot of people go to the theaters to escape staying inside all day just makes it worse for somes brains i know its a stretch to say that but thats just my opinion on it would i be sad over theaters going extinct yes would i get depressed over it no but it would force me to do other activities on weekends lets hope bowling alleys dont go extinct lol
5284,5276,SectionEight,theres always the bluray home releases to fall back on
5285,5277,bruno, andy lmao only in countries where guns are allowed this is not a problem for the rest of the world
5286,5278,Jonna King, andy yeah lets just not ever leave the house
5287,5279,N7 Charizard,i hope not i know movie theatres get a lot of flack but i love going to the cinema i love sitting in a comfy chair watching a movie with a giant screen and a snack and drink at my side
5288,5280,carlos,its awesome the only thing i hate is dudes who talks and people on their phone
5289,5281,N7 Charizard, and all the annoying gimmicks like d glasses and dbox with the moving chairs i just want to watch a regular movie with no gimmicks slapped onto it
5290,5282,SaucyX4 •, charizard woah dont disrespect the vibrating moving comfy chairs or the d movies
5291,5283,N7 Charizard,  sorry man but they arent for me while the chairs are comfy the vibrating gets quite annoying after a while and the d is often poorly implemented unless the movie is designed around it like journey to the centre of the earth for example

5596,5588,anonymous anyone,cinematography as a field would almost die phones and even tvs with sound systems at home cannot match all the effects the current cinemas and especially d but i also think that cinema halls as of now charging  bucks or more per ticket have also been too expensive lately

5609,5601,RealLifeTech,what a crybaby btch he should stop complaining when wb gives the viewers the thing he should care about most what theywe want if wb didnt pull that move people would still stop going to the theaters anyway and he would lose his income

5611,5603,Navneeth S,lew i think you miss the point here do you think that even by mid  people will still be in their home quarantining of course not covid vaccine will be out here and almost everyone in almost every country will be back to old habits and theater will be open wb said that they will be home releasing throughout  ie ever after theaters open and do you honestly think wb will remove this practice by  of course not at this point the movie industry might be completely changed and nolans quote that says  everyone will then be working for the worst streaming service rather than the big production company wb is now   becomes real

5617,5609,Justin W,china ruined everything
5618,5610,marksapollo,i would argue he is wrong about the money thats all they care about at the end of the day but streaming it will instantly open those films to a huge audience they never had access to on release day and if they keep the costs reasonable not stupidity inflated like with trolls  then i think more people will watch their films on release and they will make the same if not more money cinemas survive solely on the profits from there food and drink sales all their ticket proceeds pretty much go to the studios or distributors it was a business model that was going to fail at some pointbrof course if they stopped listening the demands of actors so much like keane reaves being awarded a multi million pay cheque and a percentage of the profits the matrix films made because a pay cheque wasnt enough or arnie who i think was given a lear jet for his terminator role in one of the films they would be much cheaper to make how about a cap on actors pay
5619,5611,marksapollo,yeah they are finished but its about time they do this i think people have big tvs and surround sound at home now but going out is also good we just cant do that at present
5620,5612,Praba Garan,pls upload in

5626,5618,TattleTeller,this will kill hollywood and the quality of movies in the future
5627,5619,marksapollo,well maybe if they stopped paying themselves so much money they wouldnt i think these directors and stars are just worried about their massively inflated pay cheques being cut

5647,5639,Gaurav Sharma,more like bthanks to streaming we have piracy nowb 
5648,5640,Gaurav Sharma, i didnt say anything wrong movies can be easily ripped through streaming platforms atleast when there was no streaming pirates had to buy blu ray discs to rip movies
5649,5641,David,exactly hes fighting against the ocean it happened to music and anyone who didnt see this coming for years is oblivious
5650,5642,Gaurav Sharma, dude it doesnt matter to him if imax is going to be bankrupt in the near future nolan would start shooting in digital the only loss would be to imax
5651,5643,tjgr17,i have  inch projector screen and  i can watch whatever i want whenever i want and however i want popcorn is pennies to make at home too
5652,5644,Mr Jenkins5000,good for you dude but no one cares
5653,5645,tjgr17, jenkins you missed the point anyone can do it movie theaters are irrelevant now because of the low cost of owning this equipment
5654,5646,Michelle A.,no going to a movie threaten streaming 
5655,5647,Courtney Moore,okay you can say popcorn is pennies but i feel like movie theatre popcorn taste better if i can just buy it and bring it home then sure
5656,5648,Hyleen Pognaire, moore they add additives  very bad for health also more money u pay for me brbrwhat good it is than your own homemade cheap and healthier popcorn

5664,5656,Hextech Magikarp,theaters will go up once people get sick with movies like netflix cuties
5665,5657,LS 7,i think theaters will stay but on a much smaller scale compared to pre covid we live in a world of change and todays world is changing at unprecedented rates things come and go
5666,5658,marksapollo,ooh netflix has an endless supply of fantastic and award winning shows and movies like prime and disney plus your opinion on them is rather limited
5667,5659,k,couples that dont own a home theaters can still go lmaooobrother people would just torrent or sub
5668,5660,SVTStrikesback,i completely understand that wb and the other studios need to make money on complete films or even films in the works  the problem is you already had this move of people watching movies on mobile devices and streaming services putting out their own contentbrbrif you are going to release these movies to streaming now i think nolan and the people on that side of the issue want to make sure its not a permanent move at leasebrbrthats my concern  if the theaters go your product will suffer immensely and you are going to have a lot of people that just dont carebrbrthe stealing of content is one issue but if you dont allow disney to make  billion off a movie now and again theyre going to quit doing it
5669,5661,mark blue,still some record stores so a few theaters may survive
5670,5662,Courtney Moore,i think in this case it will be certain movies in selected theatres

5674,5666,Mark Can,id rather it be online instead i hate going out
5675,5667,Chelsie Stinson,they should pay actors less money since films dont make as much money  everyone has to roll with the punches
5676,5668,fabianocrossman,i get why filmmakers would be upset about this decision but from the studios perspective this makes total sense given the way things are going nobody is going to theaters right now even before covid i would maybe see  or  big budget movies in cinemas the rest i would wait until i could stream but im more incentivized to buy hbo max knowing the catalog of stuff they offer and knowing that new releases will be there on day one that i can watch on my own terms that ill probably subscribe the  id spend three times a year on movies is now  a month ill spend on hbo max going to the movie theater is an experience and films that nolan makes deserve to be seen on a big screen but saying that the biggest stars in hollywood deserve better than this is egotistical warner bros recognizes that the tides are changing and theyre adapting simple as that
5677,5669,KARAN SONI,christopher nolans name is enough
5678,5670,Noob101Gaming Bruh,bro i went to see tenet in the theaters and i got to say it was a very mind twisting movie it is so hard to understand if you only watch it once it was a very mediocre film
5679,5671,Chelsie Stinson,yeah that movie was crazy
5680,5672,stranger ui,yeah its not soo mindblowing but its mind twisting
5681,5673,marksapollo,totally agree seen it and its very confusing i understood it but some of the fight scenes your brain cant work out cause of the way theyve done it i also thought the way they went between the two different states was crap and unimaginative neither did they really explain much about it all probably hoped to make a sequel to do that

5720,5712,Jose Sanchez,i think watching movies in theatres are done i wont go till they fine a cure rather stay home
5721,5713,Dariel Rodriguez,there is to change the experience of going to watch a movie with good sound quality and that huge screen at the theater the visual art plus the sound design is just better in the theater
5722,5714,Rudie Obias,i dont think movie theaters will die off i think big chains are in trouble but smaller theaters will still be around i mean people said bookstores will die off and they still aroundalbeit without some of the big chains like borders
5723,5715,Graham Jones,the experience in a cinema is completely different an people love it what they really dislike is the amount of money that it costs the tickets are pretty pricey but then theres the food which is just ridiculous the chairs arent always super comfortable compared to home viewing and then theres the travel time and for some the cost of public transport or an uber i could see a company like apple helping to save the cinema experience instead of killing it but the cons outweigh the pros right now

5730,5722,PranZ L,had the same thoughts a few days ago when i came across the news about  bollywood movies will be releasing on online platforms rather than theatres due to covid brbut lemme tell ubra home theatre cannot give u the feel amp thrill of a real cinema hall

5738,5730,Capronice,i love going to the movies i used to go at least once a week it was my escape theaters were always a place where you could catch a cold there is no way i am going to the movies until this covid  is gone the masks available to the public are not even safe we need the n mask which is made to block the virus the movie companies should make it available immediately to public if not boot leg movies will come back hard

5745,5737,sucksessless,cuz u just let a girl swipe thru her fone find u amp ask u if u wanna chill so u dont gotta take her out anymore lol
5746,5738,John Chavez,i think the answer to this question is international  are there enough countries that dealt with covid  in an effective timely enough manner to achieve a critical mass of commercially viable movie theatres  if the answer is yes then the theatres will recover in all countries if the answer is no then there will be a global format transition
5747,5739,Jono,tarantino can afford to be buried in film technicalities most people dont have same luxury with their time

5749,5741,Colin Sevier,screw liberal hollywood i quit watching when they started spewing their crap
5750,5742,Omegaman 1,good luck putting a movie theater screen in your house not just that but it gives people a reason to get out of the house its like brick and mortar stores they will always be around you can test drive the products and return or exchange the same day
5751,5743,TheSonOfAGunFrom410,films make more money with theaters a studio can get like  from getting a whole family to go to the theater if they move to home streaming you could have your whole family come over to watch a movie at a fraction of the cost
5752,5744,Kavon,ive only gotten into watching at theaters the last few years some of the best times of my life hopefully they come back when were better even as a kid with an ipod touch i couldnt watch anything on there beyond a quick youtube video i cant imagine sitting down for an entire movie length and watching a movie on one sound actually physically painful and uncomfortable on an ipad its okay but a lot less enjoyable than even a  inch tv

5759,5751,Maybe Michael Guerrero,i didnt go to the movies cuz of the  bucks for a drink and popcorn hopefully they saved up that movie money damn jews
5760,5752,Zack Kros,ive watched more of the video and now i think the episode format of netflix is horrible the movie experience should be a full movie not episodes that is why i think the movies should make their own service available to the public to watch charge money for it then make income that is the only way i see they could profit off of their failure
5761,5753,Zack Kros,movie theaters should endorse and put out streaming services themselves make a joint effort with netflix and combine their money investments into one the free movie that theaters have aspect of this time cant be good for the movie theaters and that would help their business immensely they probably wont be able to compete with netflix but it is just one idea thank you unbox therapy for the video and the way you describe this stay safe
5762,5754,Luca Veronese,stop living in the past folks do you really think covid is the last pandemic we will ever have
5763,5755,Billy Casper,the baseline is it depends on the type of the moviebrif someone suggests me to watch interstellar or revenantjust as examples in theater i definitely wouldbrbut if theres a suggestion for a film like american pie definitely not
5764,5756,Lex Boogie,movie theaters are not done i dont believe that at all maybe the days of having  of them in one city is done but the movie theater experience is not like blockbuster there will always be a big demand to see blockbuster movies in the theater and we are going to start seeing their business models start to change sure amc might go out of business but there will be tons of independent businesses that will be more than willing to take over even if it were to die out a some point people are going to miss that experience and realize how much they took it for granted
5765,5757,Kripa Singh,i rarely watch streaming videos on my phone even this video im watching on my pc monitor that supports k and hdr netflix prime and other streaming services that supports at least  dolby digital all on my personal home theater
5766,5758,Dalitso Zulu,i dont think movie theaters are in trouble i think studios may start releasing more content for online markets just last year we had a new highest grossing movie of all time the grossings from theater showings are too high to force hollywood to make decisions to put theaters in danger
5767,5759,James Macleod,personally i cant wait for them to return i miss the  foot screen big movie on a big screen it the only way to go
5768,5760,bill clay,too much excellent scripted tv for me to really care anymore  i love movies but there wasnt much getting me to the theater before covid  movies and well recorded tv on my xhr open back headphones is just as incredible  maybe for families and animated stuff and the occasional nolan flick it will still be a thing
5769,5761,Harey Pujols,movies are meant for the big screen not matter how much money you spend on your home theater you just cant get the same experience
5770,5762,Ricky Nuggets,nobody cares about the experience of a giant image with a good sound system i prefer watching movies with my family eating whatever food and drink i like also any room with  people is a hot muggy uncomfortable experience no matter how oversized the screen is when i walk out of a theater i remember the movie just as well as i did watching it from home i dont need a giant screen to see whats going on any better than my home television
5771,5763,Justin Benjamin,it will be hard to recover the justification for the timed theater exclusivity
5772,5764,whatever,i never go to theaters theyre usually crowded and people talk or some smell its annoying its a great place to share germs and viruses the only good thing about a theater is some of the food but then its expensive and its hard to watch a movie in a theater and eat at the same time without annoying people sitting next to you i watch movies at home or if theres a drive in but theyve been closed for years i always thought drive ins were way better
5773,5765,TiVo2Go,bmovie theaters been in trouble ever since the price of flatscreens amp projectors droppedbbrbcovid is just speeding up things that are on the way out the door anywaybbrbnews papers  why wait for the morning paper when the news already updated since it came off the press and you can get a live update on your phonebbrbweather man  same with the phone i can get a daily day amp day forecast with voice andor moving symbols amp picsbbrbbusiness landlords  if most of the world is working from home why go back to paying rent and for office spacebbrbentertainment  most of the bars clubs concerts etc are only for extroverts who are losing their minds that they have to spend a night inside  not enough extroverts to keep those places open just look at amazon brick and mortars are only only for extroverts who want to walk around for hours only to pick up a bluray or a pack of candybbrbintroverts like me are happy i can order everything on amazon stop by the liquor store and get some beers plop in front of the big screen or projector and play my digitally downloaded games on the switch ps amp xboone stream any tv show or movieb

5824,5816,burnoutjunkie42,as far as i can tell movie theaters will have a huge boom in sales just like retail amp restaurants people are so bored that they just dont care about the risks whatsoever
5825,5817,Kirsten roberts,boyc ott amc purchased by ccp in  aka the chinese communist party the tortureamp kill millions of ethnic minorities and then when theyre good and dead china sells their organs on the black market not a pretty picture free tibet  stand up for taiwan support freedom for hong kong china is duplicitous world bully cannot be trusted bow vassals theyre now the kerberos it speaks with poisoned fork tongues the beast needs put to sleep here are stages step  create a highly contagious disease via bats amp wet markets step  destroy lie and suppress evidence of disease  step  reap financial benefits fallout buy up as many businesses bankrupt by covid like airlines etc step  pirate a vaccine ampmake drugs masks and tests power rinse and repeatbravo xi jinping mendacious master propaganda plan succeeds while world freaks the fuke out lovely  chinas been on a buyout binge worldwide since  boycott china acquired ge smithfield foods motorola hilton sinopec amc and the list goes on about time we put them on a diet

5827,5819,Danielle King,you cant beat a giant screen and a big soundsystem especially with the spectacular filmsthe thriller genre and other low key films are fine on a small screen and my friend has a projector that is nice for watching films and she has a nice speaker system as well but there is nothing like seeing a real blockbuster on a very large screen and i hope cinemas survive the pandemic cinema survived televisionvideo rentals and dvds and bluraysprojectors at home are not always possible though you can get short throw projectors or quite large tvs these days but all the same i would still want to go see a film on a large screen sometimes 
5828,5820,Outpizza The hut,they need to start serving beer and food at the theaters like the old ones boy howdy id love to have a nice drink in a theater
5829,5821,SirVern,gamestop vibes just a matter of time

5831,5823,Plebdominus Rex,i think theaters are far from dead there are movies you just cant watch at home some movies need to be watched on the big screen and not only that netflix cant produce the same level of quality that movies in theater can
5832,5824,MAC EGAN,i only liked the movie theater for one reason it somewhat kept people off their phones its far too easy for people to get distracted at home its unfortunate that you have to pay for discipline everyone lacks that discipline at home i rarely watch a movie in its entirety when i watch with my woman she ends up in the bed on her phone and i end up back on the game
5833,5825,MrCheech813,movies and popcorn  bluray

5839,5831,Tim Smith,its like death of the drivein people have a lot of other ways to entertain themselves and spend their extra money one other thing at least for me im tired of movie people preaching how im bad and need to pay my taxes while they have residence in low or no tax states instead of the high tax state they spend a lot of their time is california
5840,5832,penandpaper,this conversation seemed like it ended just as it was starting
5841,5833,Gus,movie theatres are never going to go away the experience is just completely different unless everyone can afford a high end home theatre
5842,5834,King Karpe Visuals,people that think that theaters are done obviously dont go on dates as long as they stay open people will always go
5843,5835,RiGo,my note  plus has a better resolution than my bang amp olufsen tv i can imagine watching more on my phone especially if the refresh rate translates to media on my phone
5844,5836,Shadow IV,this reminds me of arcades yes im that old arcades has better graphics and quotonline gamingquot in the form of beating up locals in fighting games fortunately home consoles became so powerful and online gaming started basically making the case for why are we going to arcades the same thing is happening for movies you got k hdr dolby atmos and your pick of food to eat why would i pay  per person at a location i have to drive to when i can simply watch the movie in the comfort of my home with an arguably better setup than the theater in terms of visual and sound i dont even want to get into the fact that people break out their phones and have conversations with people while the movie is on at a theater for that alone id rather pay to rent a movie at home
5845,5837,ATYCHIPHOBIA,whats the problem the hateful  was released in  so anyone can download the movie online and watch it
5846,5838,LogicWorldz,the future is now old man movie theaters are a thing of the past the future is digital i rather watch in the comfort of my home with friends and family then spend  bucks just to see a movie in a shitty dirty theater
5847,5839,LogicWorldz,elijah morris says who lol my television cost me a total of  sony bravia smart tvs are affordable and good quality why pay to sit in a dirty theater
5848,5840,The Reason,apple or tesla or amazon should come in and create some super futuristic totally different movie experience and change that space
5849,5841,Scott_itall,they are they will die out like video stores did or the drive in did no issue have a  k tv with surround sound i rather movies go straight to netflix to be honest
5850,5842,Scott_itall,elijah morris long term investment
5851,5843,Scott_itall,elijah morris nah on their way out may have been good once they are out done just like dvd removed vhs or netflix removed blockbuster
5852,5844,Brandon Sloan,theaters are not going away in our lifetime end of discussion we are social beings
5853,5845,Jaffa Cakes,think about  it most people have netflix amazon  which means any movie made by these two has more audience then any  movies that come out in cinema
5854,5846,COSMIC QUEST,i completely disagree that they are done do you know how much money they will lose if they go vod and or streaming platforms its not viable financially to do that they need to make the money back from marketing budget and paying actors just loosely saying that theatres are done without doing the research is not proper way to tackle the situation accurately
5855,5847,Prabhat Kumar,worst  is coming people download for free
5856,5848,Dominick Ray,bring drive ins back

5871,5863,Jg Rsb,amc is now owned by a chinese company i wont go to an amc theater and prop up china
5872,5864,S Wesley Harris,i think the theatre experience is built on a house of cards the theatre company has to make its money basically on food and beverages the margin for profits is not really great especially if the theatre capacity is reduced hollywood is spending too much making a lot of remakes that dont bring in the numbers like they used to and theatres are left with smaller numbers this trend cant go on forever but seriously youd rather stay at home and watch a movie on your home system are you that lazy home systems dont compare at all some people need to get off their buts more or there wont be any place to go accept to order things on amazon or have a million subscriptions
5873,5865,Borderlands808,i will always support movie theaters
5874,5866,MrClyjade,clubs movies and events are all there to conjure up the public to give them money  in masses parks and casino all that stops
5875,5867,Resident NotEvil,movies suck ass these days so idgaf tbh
5876,5868,Tahoe Boy,biggest problem with drive in movies is people will park on a hill somwhere and watch the movie without paying i know cuz ive done it and there were more people with us than in the drive in

5885,5877,ChrisKeepitG,yup movies will die soon give it  years or less
5886,5878,Benito Valenzuela,interstellar in the theater is an experience
5887,5879,J Alvarez,no people dont just go to the movies to watch a movie they go to eat freshly popped warm buttery popcorn with ice cold coca cola and some creamy chocolates they go because of the amazing size of the movie and the speakers around them movie theaters will not die soon
5888,5880,Patrick Goodspeed,i dont really enjoy going to a movie theater anymore it hasnt been a compelling experience for a long time now modern theaters are crappy pricey and often ruined by someones being disruptive  my home movie experience overall is better siting in front of my tv
5889,5881,chrichtonsworld,screens are getting bigger and better and as a huge film fan i prefer to watch films in theaters but there have been quite a few a titles i definitely would have felt like i had wasted my money tickets cost too much as are the snacks and drinks lower the prices and fans like me will go to the cinema also a lot of films are far too drawn out make them shorter and tighter if you dont have that much substance brbrthat being said the quality of the films really have to be improved and they really have to give you that cinema feeling otherwise what would be the point of watching those films in theatersbrbri have a projector and big screen certain films definitely still are magical but most of recent films are so bad i dont even turn on the projector for those since it would be a waste of lamp hours
5890,5882,Christopher Newby,i go to the cinema once a week and always will
5891,5883,1drsy,so people only have phones
5892,5884,neoasura,i could care less if they close i work nd shift from pmam no theater close to me was open early enough or late enough to see a movie with my work schedule i havent been able to go to a theater in years due to work not to mention the last time i was at the theater it was distracting with all the kids throwing popcorn and cellphones going off people pushing by me to use the bathroom etc so i made my own theater in my house let them close for all i care it just means ill get to view them at home much much sooner hell you can even charge movie ticket prices like pay per view i quotexperiencedquot the theater experience enough for my lifetime
5893,5885,Wook Rott,vr sytems are the movie theaters of the future odeon aps  a movie like the cinemas did in uk which before lockdown had made cinemas busy again as  a ticket nearly killed cinema in uk  or so people before price reduction
5894,5886,juanfonseca31,i dont think movie theaters are done because that movie experience is never going to be replicated in home unless you are rich and you have a dedicated movie theater room with all the tech necessary to reproduce the exact movie experience in terms of sound and picture and before anyone says oh but there is sound bars that sound really good and in dolby atmos sorry but no those sound bars are garbage period maybe some mid range to hiend av receivers sound really good but never ever those are going to replicate the movie theater unless like i said before you are rich and besides going to the movie theater is an excuse to going out and just have fun with the family and friends so movie theaters is not going anywhere movie theater are going to stay for a long time
5895,5887,rockstatus90,you can get the big screen and good sound experience if you use a vr headset there is even apps to join others to watch the movie so you get the reactions too the whole movie theatre experience can be had without going to the movies
5896,5888,Acácio Bernardo,the future is go to a theater in vr and then look down through the nose gap to multitask on your phone 
5897,5889,Cameron Clark,idk about you but im not paying  to rent a movie
5898,5890,Tsunami Tube,is it just me that thinks netflix is  junkbrapart from some original series and movies that have been on most content is trash brcan literally flick through for an hour and not see anything worth watching
5899,5891,HeyItsLewi,i dont mind watching most movies for a first time on a screen and at home because its more comfortable for me but i always prefer watching action movies in theatres big screen showing all the action and the speakers booming shit forgot thats not cinema ill shut up

5901,5893,Payton Johnson,not an experience anymore are you nuts nothing compares to imax
5902,5894,NOBEL,there will still be movie theatre i believe but it wont be exclusively released on the movie theatre its just if you want to experience the movie in the movie theatre you will be able to do it
5903,5895,Fredrik,i doubt it since they film all tv series in movie theatre format nowadays with giant black bars when you try to watch them at home so they expect their tv series to be watched in the movie theatre
5904,5896,John Doe,correct me if i am wrong but doesnt the lens size directly affects the aspect ratio not the resolution
5905,5897,PSYCHO,cant wait to watch tenet in imax mm brbrmy video watching preferencebr theater screensbrbr very large tvsbrbr small monitorbrbr my inch smartphone screen mainly for tv shows on hulu

5909,5901,Daniel Munoz,i used to love going to the theater but i havent been in probably  years or so and honestly dont really miss it as much as i probably would have thought
5910,5902,Jesus,we definitely miss the movie theaters theyre not going anywhere
5911,5903,OB,its expensive if you take a family of four plus concessions parking tickets it comes easily to  thats too much if you compare renting it at home
5912,5904,Rodrigo Pacheco,is that a razer 
5913,5905,RYG,i did watch hatefull  in mm and right now id say the best cinema is x screen i often get so tired over my screens that i find phones or ipads more enjoyable

5921,5913,Brickandmorty,sherlyn a yeah nobody needs to like even if you wanna watch it twice still cheaper than buying it
5922,5914,Tim Possible,people arent going to stop going to the movies because they can watch it at home thats like saying no one will go to bars because they can drink at home
5923,5915,Gaur8n,i dont watch movies on my phone but tarantino is a tool of the snob variety i support theaters but i dont support people with a narrow view of what entertainment and acting should be the genre doesnt matter  an actor and script that makes you connect with the characters and get swept up in the story are all that matters
5924,5916,Mahamed Hassan,i dont think movie theaters will ever die off
5925,5917,CyberData4,its content how its ingested should be up to the viewer brbri watch movies on many different platforms theater k  laptop tablet phone and yes modern technology offer more convenience to the consumer as it should
5926,5918,Manuel Junior,what do think of netflix adding some sport to their contentbrit would disrupt tv sport industry
5927,5919,Laurent de backer,to be honest i liked to go to a movie theater because of the sound and the big screen experience but passed couple of yrs i didnt enjoy it as much you will always have people who do some stupid things like shining with their iphone light to the screen or just laugh really loud to be annoying on purpose throw popcorn at you or even spit at people and this for me is just really why i dont really like going to the movie anymore when i think about it here at home i have a quotquot tv which i will upgrade to quot k by the end of this year and i do have a nice surround system im also much more relax in my couch and i have drinks and snacks as many as i want so its a really much nicer experience
5928,5920,Navardo Wallace - Gill,i barely even like watching trailers on my phone  ill never watch a movie on my phone
5929,5921,EbFilesX,i said the same thing until i bought a  phone with gorgeous colors
5930,5922,Sherlyn A., yep once you go oled and big other screens look terrible
5931,5923,Unknown Known,i wonder what the percentage breakdown is of new movies that go to movie theatres first versus streaming services too lazy to google it
5932,5924,Trent,this pisses me off so much going to the cinema is one of the best things to do everything should push to get an alamo draft house theatre in their hometowns
5933,5925,Shion The Hollow,people have always watched films at home its not a case of one versus the other movie theatres will be around for a very long time
5934,5926,Nick,evolve or become extinct romantic emotional statements do not serve the needs and wants of the many
5935,5927,Sqweeky Badger,just before covid i read somewhere that a company was trying to bring cinema releases to the home at the same time
5936,5928,Jason S,unless i have a home theater a real one with movie theater type seats and a wall sized projection screen i will be going to theaters to see movies  watching on a tv whether it is  inches or not is not the same
5937,5929,Jibby,theaters are literally the only method of enjoying new movies
5938,5930,Ricky Nuggets,lol no that is not true at all
5939,5931,Jibby, nuggets was my opinion not implied
5940,5932,lafeil,it the movie theaters go away it going have big impact on hollywood
5941,5933,Brickandmorty,not really content will just get better and itll all be on netflix i think itll be a good thing
5942,5934,Brickandmorty,look at the success of altered carbon vs how blade runner  failed if it was released on netflix it wouldve been far more profitable
5943,5935,Gary Stinten,if production companies decided to stream movies online through and all you can eat service and you could pick production companymovietv show things like cinemas would cease to exist along with netflix and amazon and hulu etc brbrproviding they had a back catalogue and ppv for new releases i would happily pay around  a year
5944,5936,John-Paul Hunt,good our first transforming of society into a better more privately moving viewing era post making soda and concessions for the home with screens and ai for that screw movie theaters being obsolete in big tech vs the conservative hollywood elites
5945,5937,Brickandmorty,johnpaul hunt the hollywood elites are all liberals buddy
5946,5938,John-Paul Hunt, im a liberal i think theyre a bunch of socialist communist china now as thats where the money is now hollywood is a political it is not really political in the sense of democratrepublican it is more about its own pocketbook like most corporations like fedex are for hiding money from the irs member wesley snipes in the independent report as celebrities in sports source also hide their money outside the us to avoid the irs because of bank secrecy laws
5947,5939,Brickandmorty,johnpaul hunt you do have a point as anthony mackie said last year hollywood makes movies for china and teenagers but there is a huge liberal slant where most of the movies being released has some kind of forced diversity and while i think diversity is a good thing it should never take away from the movie like it should make sense stuff like making ariel black or making james bond a woman is just pandering like id rather they come up with new black characters like django or mace windu
5948,5940,John-Paul Hunt, elites are still the elites ie old rich men that dont listen until they get hit in the pocket book anything else as hollywood is like ea and ms in e in  selling me lies lol
5949,5941,Luis DeLeon,they should of kept drive in movie theaters
5950,5942,The Dry Down,this guy reminds of lou from unbox therapy interesting
5951,5943,tankbxy,watching newly released movies at home without first seeing them in the movie theater is probably the wackest shit i can think of fucking garbage
5952,5944,TIGER LORD,were movie theatres really trending down before the pandemic i mean avengers endgame broke records i remember reading deadpool breaking records for a feb release those were both in the past few years with a few exceptions the last year or so there just havent been a lot of movies worth seeing in the theatre personally i love going to the movies i just categorize them based on whether its worth paying to see it in the theatre or not if its a movie with good reviews and lots of special effects i definitely go see it in the theatre i do this also for movies i personally want to see because im a fan of the genre or the directoractor i go to the drive in regularly as well and its cool but not the same experience hopefully covid gets sorted out over the next year or so i want to see the new avatar in imax and im already pissed i havent been able to see wonder woman and the new james bond flick
5953,5945,Get hacked loser Haha,the theatre wont die as long as theres marvel movies
5954,5946,Matthew Irizarry,imo comic book movies are helping kill movie theatres
5955,5947,Official Filmilen,its expensive to go to the cinemas its much easier to watch a movie or tv series on netflix
5956,5948,Regginald Williams,drive ins are back
5957,5949,Serjohn,i never liked cinema its too much trouble for just a movie i dont even watch movies with other people since we got together i much rather play sports video games or chat i highly suggest ping pong i love it in my opinion much better than bowling darts and billiard i dont like the turns some people take way too long during their turn i much rather play ping pong i love the back and forth and that its indoors
5958,5950,Mad Boi,just build a home theater i have a in screen with a k projector 
5959,5951,Mad Boi, s yeah well if they lowered there popcorn prices and snacks st the concession stands maybe more ppl would go often
5960,5952,Mad Boi, s damn bro im not that old lol but yeah i can understand your pain
5961,5953,thebas3rd,god damn
5962,5954,PSYCHO,if your home theater inch screen isnt micro led then its not worth itbrbrgo to a samsung screen movie theater where they installed micro led i bet itll ruin your home theater experience afterwards lol
5963,5955,PSYCHO, boi the popcorn and snacks are what pays the rent for movie theatersbrbrinflation is a thing too at least in the us hence why prices keep going up as the years pass by
5964,5956,Tsunami Tube, perhaps if they didnt pay actors tens of  millions for a movie the tickets would be cheaper br million for jonny depp in pirates br million for robert downey in marvel franchisesbrim sure they could live with just a million per moviebrcinemas arent the ripoff its hollywood
5965,5957,Mad Boi, not really bro all my friends enjoy my home theater bc my screen is made from immersive k paint with crystal edge technology
5966,5958,Henrik Pettersson,horrormovies are great in theaters the reactions from the audience ads to the experience
5967,5959,PhantomLink,what horror movies have you been watching the last good one is hell raiser
5968,5960,Grasher134,i just laughed in theaters during those
5969,5961,Aaron Stark,i saw alien in a theater a few years back  i used to think that cliche you see in movies and on tv where people are in a theater watching a horror movie and the audience covers their fave with their hands was bullshit  not anymore  but i will say that while that one was a helluva experience most horror movies are pretty terrible
5970,5962,imahelpfulperson,thats not enough to keep them alive tho
5971,5963,TheRoaming Savage,i said the same thing aboit going as a family to blockbuster to pick out a movie then i said the same thing about gamestop going for the experience and u have no idea how many brats have no problem badmouthing and bankrupting a company so that they never have to get their lazy fat asses off the couch and leave their doritos for more than  minutesbri hope im wrong but if movie theatres follow suit it will be another thing that becomes extinct
5972,5964,Pranav haran,i heard that a ticket in the us theater costs like  dollars no wonder theatres are dying in india theatres are pretty expensive and still they cost a maximum of  dollars
5973,5965,Tsunami Tube,if a dollar is worth  times more than a rupee then you pay the same amount brif  dollar is worth more than  rupees you are paying more my friend
5974,5966,Roma Krelian,wtf kind of loser wants to just sit at home all the time
5975,5967,Rhakesh G,ofcourse its convenient watching movies at home but going to the theatre is an experience still for me watching top notch films in imax is what i live for
5976,5968,Rich FromThe7th,i miss my towns movie theater i used to go every time and watch movies yes by myself thats best part
5977,5969,Joey Carrino,people dont say phones or tablets anymore sheep
5978,5970,Rodrigo Costa,if movie theaters go down they can as well stop making movies i hate netflix its just the illusion of choice  of their movie content is crap  besides that you cant recreate the feeling of going to the cinema with your friends kids its soooo much more than the film experience only when i go to the film with my son on a rainy sunday afternoon we go to eat something afterward enjoy the moment together closing movie theaters will erode social cohesion in our society as will the end of all the other things that risk being in our past pubs clubs mass gatherings because of covid i sure hope the tradeoff in safety we are getting for it is worth the sacrifice
5979,5971,Brandon,netflix is the best
5980,5972,Rod,ive been to drivein many times but i dont remember seeing any movies lol
5981,5973,Tragedy,lew movie theatres are done forbrme whos working at a movie theatre listening to this really
5982,5974,killler240,i think a few will always be around but numbers will decrease
5983,5975,Courtney Moore,your profile photo goes perfectly with your comment
5984,5976,Gaming FireDrago,if youre a student then watch my latest video
5985,5977,Michael Halteh,being in the movie theatre is just a different experience cant beat the big screen along with all the badass sound  not to mention the social experience these streaming services cant offer
5986,5978,Max Ramos,especially the  mm imax films like nolans dunkirk brcamerons alita battle angel
5987,5979,TJ,social experience there is usually only  people in a theatre when i go
5988,5980,Jon Morales,thomas  yeah like hearing other people laugh with you or saying oh shit when something crazy happens theatre is totally a social experience if you want it to belike going opening weekend to a movie vs when only  people are there
5989,5981,imahelpfulperson,coronavirus am i a joke to you
5990,5982,ICE T,u can get disease too from visiting a movie theatre
5991,5983,from 0 to Ux,i have been enjoying projector life for movies  inch screen for a long time just need to spend a a few dollars on good projector and screen but it makes me not miss the theatre at all so much cooler having a theatre in your own place and the cost isnt that bad for p native projectors its always cool to have friends over at and flex with the big screen and leds behind it and when it comes to snacks for movie time i also go hard lolwhen is  the last time you had good nachos and dip at the theatre a href
5992,5984,coovv,did netflix release the virus to kill theaters
5993,5985,Brandon,great plan 
5994,5986,--,the thing that sucks balls about movie theaters is the hordes of imbeciles talking and texting  id like it if theaters became more about culture and less about paying  to have a conversation with your friends
5995,5987,Ghaffar_KH,going to the movies is an experience thats just isnt the same as watching it at home its like watching a concert live from your house instead of going there for yourself it just isnt the same
5996,5988,neoasura,we said the same thing about drive ins yet those still got closed down even though they would make good money now no new drive ins are opening
5997,5989,Raymond Rodriguez,practically the same ur just in seats as opposed to in a car with the radio being home with all the distractions etc etc  just aint the same as going out with a crowed room with popcorn n a date just not the same
5998,5990,Kyd,the movies stopped being an experience a long time ago and watching things on projection screens are a norm now some ppl will return dont get me wrong but like they said its dying
5999,5991,Kyd,sunnohh or save the money you would normally use to go to the movies and save it to build a awesome one in your basement for a family of four the money you would save youd have it in a year 
6000,5992,e val79,but one factor for a drive in to work or movie theater is good solid movies there just arent enough of those anymore regardless of the covid
6001,5993,Paolo Rodríguez,thats true at least for me it iswas an experience problem is that nowadays we are too lazy and too self centered that even if it is arguably a better experience we are more than willing to sacrifice that for the sake of staying home in our beds
6002,5994,Slang Yung,avatar  hold my labatt blue
6003,5995,Charles Laari,will is a yes man lol
6004,5996,Theo G,nah you guys are wrong movie theater arent over at all
6005,5997,Ambi Dextrose,let him walk out lol his movies arent even that good anymore
6006,5998,neoasura,for real i thought he was retiring he always says this film is his last film and blah blah
6007,5999,Dane Pacheco,nah i disagree i love going to a movie theater
6008,6000,Ricky Nuggets,and i love arcades that didnt stop them form going away
6009,6001,strangeKE,i dont want theaters to die i like the big picture experience
6010,6002,Gary Stinten,wait until vr becomes popular then cinemas will die
6011,6003,strangeKE,gary stinten i can kinda see that who knows
6012,6004,Ariel Riq,lowcost mini projectors could motivate the experience of watching movies on the big screen at home as costs go down
6013,6005,PSYCHO,nah it wouldnt work because most average viewers when at home tend to watch movies and tv shows in bright rooms with the lights on they dont quotwant their kids to go blindquot etc a projector is literally meant for dark room viewing
6014,6006,Zach Swasta,as a movie purist myself i second tarantinos sentiments movies were always meant to be watched big and loud in a dark room full of strangers where it envelopes you so you cant pause and rewind brbranything less is a lazy mans game the art of cinema will not die to accomodate our societys downgrade dont act like the laziness of our species is a good thing to uphold just because of some petty outrage over the price concessions you can choose to skip
6015,6007,Markus Scott,rent new releases at  or go pay  per family member at the movies
6016,6008,Tech Knowledgy,maybe if their tickets and food didnt cost an arm and leg it would last longer we are there for the experience not to be robbed
6017,6009,PSYCHO,you dont know the meaning of the word robbed brbrno ones forcing you to pay the prices for movie tickets andor snacks
6018,6010,Tech Knowledgy, i do we get robbed legally just like taxes we dont want to pay but we do it anyway
6019,6011,PSYCHO, knowledgy cant you at least understand that prices go up due to inflation at least in the usbrbrthe foodsnacks and drinks are what pay the rent every month for all theaters
6020,6012,Tech Knowledgy, why do you care so much do you own a theater or something its way too expensive i live in new zealand it cost  dollars for tickets and  for a double couple meal which is too reg popcorn drink and icecream i have been to new york and it is cheaper in usa
6021,6013,Juan Yepez,i enjoy going to the movies
6022,6014,G-Mac85 Johnson,the movie theater that is basically dead covid  outbreak most people are changing habits and of stay order across the united states and all of european countries movie streaming sites like netflix and hulu and disney plus and hbo max and and amazon prime video and youtube tv and sling tv all these platforms have been better because of covid streaming movies make for the movie they already do it now as soon as the movie comes out download movies it goes directly to ppv  for years on directv
6023,6015,West Nile, bucks for a regular pack of skittles theaters been dead plus i have inches
6024,6016,S1X Bucks,what is happening here is the story hes talking about super old or something im confused
6025,6017,fetB,cinemas are overrated making a home cinema is easy granted you have the spare room
6026,6018,Theo G,cinemas are not overrated they are overpriced though
6027,6019,fetB,that might be true too but i havent been i years and i dont know the expensives behind it but i do know you can get the same audiovideo quality maybe even better because you can target the sound more directly and level the eye sight properly and you dont have to deal with coughing people time constraint etc
6028,6020,fetB, morris sure initial investment is there but so is a car whats your point sooner or later that investment is spend either way all the while you have a better experience right out of the gate
6029,6021,fetB,lol
6030,6022,Mac Mac,why hasnt cinemas amp video gamers joined forces yet
6031,6023,BMLMZ,i hope we can get back to theaters  i love the experience
6032,6024,ŤÈMPŁÂŘ,its possible but the problem would be seating changes which are costly and would make it so less people can be in a room also probably higher cost tickets
6033,6025,Anshveer Singh,now you are missing it but once you are sitting in a hall with s of people things will be different
6034,6026,Anthony H,i love the theatres i go every tuesday  now i cant and its annoying as hell
6035,6027,Mishi,that is nearly impossible
6036,6028,mackemftm74,the irony of this is in  when star wars was rereleased in the cinema i went to see it on the big screen just because all id ever known was seeing it on my tv
6037,6029,Abu Adam 2020,same here 
6038,6030,Twilightwild,i always said streaming would be the future
6039,6031,Graeme L,ill take an  tv and a surround system over an overpriced filthy cinema ill only go if its a nolan imax spectacle
6040,6032,Paul What,totally agree theaters are best
6041,6033,FabityChannel,overpriced    is too much per person
6042,6034,Graeme L,fabitychannel thats all well and good when youre single try going to the cinema with a wife and kids who all want coke and popcorn damn right its overpriced
6043,6035,Zakaria Iaazza,imax is superior
6044,6036,blanchbacker,zak x aria  inch screen and a reference level atmos system is the same fucking thing if its a movie available in imax enhanced
6045,6037,Forcemaster2000,by next year this time only imax theaters will still be operating and it will be more like an amusement park type experience tickets will be  per and the seating will be spread out more only blockbuster movies like marvel superhero and big action flicks will see theater distribution everything else will be vod
6046,6038,Emanuel Dumea,i never watch movies on my phone if i cant watch a movie in theater ill watch it on a tv or big pc monitor
6047,6039,michael jai vincent,agreed
6048,6040,Know Thyself,on the phone sucks
6049,6041,ThePeddle,exactly unless you are stuck somewhere why in the fawk would you watch it on a  inch screen
6050,6042,Bryan Miller,doesnt matter cuz people generally watch movies on tv using the same services theyd would use a phone so its still taking away the movie theater
6051,6043,420EveryDay,mohammed anna then step up your game boi
6052,6044,Nash Scheber,i connect my phone to my tv so i can watch new movies
6053,6045,John-Paul Hunt,sony xperia  k and k native phone for both watching movies and shooting them haha
6054,6046,dacontagc,im personally happy to see the theater industry fail  its way too expensive and after failing they should figure out a better business model and try to make something better
6055,6047,B H,watching movies on your phone sucks compared to going to a theater
6056,6048,nateliontrueleo🦁,movie theater should stick around so we can have somewhere to take our date
6057,6049,jj,nahh pull out the phone and watch it  macdonalds
6058,6050,Sherlyn A., lol
6059,6051,jj,i watch everything for free on my phone obviously not an iphone lol
6060,6052,Michael Soldate,why would you knowingly get ripped off at a theater some people feel nastolga to keep them alive but that wont keep them alive only innovation when i can cast anything from my phone to my tv instantly for a few bucks a theaters proposition is just bad business
6061,6053,Alen Napotnik,while i do love the convenience of streaming i love going to the cinema also not for every movie but some are worth seeing on the big screen  and going to a movie theater is a an experience a night out im sure they will stay around and im pretty sure the big movie studios will keep releasing most or at least major films  exclusively in cinemas at first as they receive a lot more revenue from that people wont wait months to see a new marvel movie at home when they could go to the cinema and see it when it comes out 
6062,6054,stryfetc1,you wont have to wait months when they come straight to streaming services
6063,6055,MVE,movie theaters will only have a chance again if there is a vaccin otherwise they could be a virus superspreader inhouse bad ventilation humid people shouting and economically not worth it anymore with social distancing only a limited people can be in a movie theater
6064,6056,JDL,what is it with the ipad thing is it just me or do these directors and producers not realize that there are kcapable pixel slates and decent samsung android tablets out there is tablet a bad word dude i dont get it
6065,6057,Brandon,because apple is most well known
6066,6058,Jesus Borjas,a cinema here in el paso opened and i just disapprove lol
6067,6059,H3C,so what can i do taking a risk of getting the covid just for to see a movie in cinema  who is mad
6068,6060,vynckier97,i dont get it tho the hateful  is already on netflix in my country
6069,6061,stryfetc1,theyve been in trouble for a while thobefore the plannedemic
6070,6062,Sachin,nowadays all have home theatres with pretty nice wifi home is the new theatre
6071,6063,Markbriscoe,the cinema is over
6072,6064,Part4,tarantino is also planning to make a real theatre about hateful eight the script is so good that it could be done in many ways
6073,6065,wolverine,yh eventually cinematheatres will all close down probably by 
6074,6066,Part4,the movie theaters will always be there they are part of our culture and they are not going anywhere
6075,6067,TruBlacKing 85,facts
6076,6068,Ricky Nuggets,the famous last words of every dying industry
6077,6069,Part4, nuggets nolan said this
6078,6070,Ricky Nuggets, so what it doesnt matter who said it its still wrong
6079,6071,Part4, nuggets what will happen after this pandemic will be over people will continue watching netflix at home ahahah the cinemas will trend again and who said that you can get the same feeling you get with a movie you watch at a cinema and a movie you watch on netflix
6080,6072,Ricky Nuggets, theaters were already dying long before the pandemic this virus was just an extra push in the right direction
6081,6073,Sasuke Uchiha,i do see the movie theater experience getting replace by the drive in theaters  just with whats going on now drive in theaters are going to be virus proof  youre in your own car can bring your own snacks  can talk together in your car  you can bring friends and family and even have a little cook out or get high  i know drive ins were ultimately replace  but i see them making a comeback  showing the older movies does make going to the movies a better experience 
6082,6074,Alberto Montesinos,omg
6083,6075,G T,i think everyone can agree watching it at home isnt as good as the cinema however cinemas are so overpriced they need to make it an experience that you cant get at home such as massive recliners and make it affordable
6084,6076,Ace D,people are itching to get out of their houses asap ill be going to the movies every chance i get once they open back up
6085,6077,Jay Wes,a big screen tv and home theater sound system will never compare to a theater screen or sound system i get ppl not wanting to pay the high prices anymore but go to the theater for the right movies blockbusters and watch the other movies at home
6086,6078,Edgar Acosta,i dont get it i literally just rented the hateful eight through my apple movies
6087,6079,Julious Bass,tarintino is a bigot
6088,6080,SIBI TV,what may be cause of viruses
6089,6081,Mark Can,there are many things that were dying even before covid just slowly this pandemic increased it massively
6090,6082,Brickandmorty,just like what andrew schulz was talking about
6091,6083,Adrian Elias,exacerbated it
6092,6084,MyNameisGrex,jklego studios  which video
6093,6085,Matt Stovetop,prices keep going up on things but wages arent not going to pick up an extra shift just so i can take the family to the theatres
6094,6086,i'm JGott, stovetop bryup tickets gone up food gone up and the experience is opinionated just depends on the crowd that is present the only theater i would go to is alamo drafthouse not sure on your location but the theater is more adult themed where kids arent really present
6095,6087,Brickandmorty,mynameisgrex when he was on rogan recently talking about businesses with prexisting conditions and how corona exposed them
6096,6088,Conor Hearne,unsynced
6097,6089,Bliggity,i think they should stick around in a larger format they need to have the best food and drink and really clean cool environments you should feel you are getting your moneys worth every time you walk in the door i have felt  fleeced every time i set foot in a cinema
6098,6090,Stefan Genov,cinema experience will never change people like to visit cinema its not the same as watching netflix at home
6099,6091,Mark Can,your wrong lol embrace technology
6100,6092,Jon Lee,how much cash have you spent on cameras and lighting lew brill just watch it on my phone whilst working with occasional glances br
6101,6093,SuperDave87,saw the title and was like well yeah lol
6102,6094,ANTHONY BERRIOS,i hope movie theaters do come back it would suck to watch all movies at home and i definitely wanna see tenet in dx
6103,6095,Will Forrest-King,the only way id stop going to the cinema is if i managed to get one of my own home cinemas
6104,6096,Explore With Rick,me why do you have so many tabs openbrlew yes
6105,6097,Explore With Rick,do people still even go to the movies
6106,6098,Nacho the Don,ill be at the theaters on day 
6107,6099,stranger ui,me too
6108,6100,PSYCHO,tenet in imax mm baby best film of 
6109,6101,Inspirado Rupees,nunya bizness  but i dont wanna possibly die
6110,6102,Martin Esquivel,if they offer new movies for rent in my house on my tv at k i would rather stay home
6111,6103,Andy Cornejo,they are prob gonna make it so you have to buy a ticket to watch the movie at a certain time etc like movies rn but in your living room instead
6112,6104,1RN19EI004,watching movies in theatre is a tradition the experience u get from it going st day st show  going with people u love  friends etc cannot be compared with any display platform even if u have an oled tv with dolby atmos being social is one of the best ways to keep ur mind healthy
6113,6105,Aashley Saggar,not when ur  possible death is hidden among those peoplebrits the age of social distancing so i guess thats how it works
6114,6106,1RN19EI004, saggar  meant after all the corona stuff gets under control
6115,6107,1RN19EI004, seinfeld  thats really awesome in case of blockbuster u pick up movies that has already been released which u have watched before and u want to watch it again or which u havnt watched before coz of some reasons etc and i have also seen many people regret not watching such movies in theatre just saying movies that are being released in the present is better to watch in theatres than sitting at home or experience both by watching in theaters and later buying the blueray and watch it on an oled
6116,6108,1RN19EI004, seinfeld and one more important thing a movie which u watch in theater u tend to remember it for the rest of your life whether it was with ur gf family or a cringe friend who tries to show how loud he can laugh for a joke
6117,6109,1RN19EI004, 
6118,6110,Mark Pugh,you cant catch covid with netflix and chill
6119,6111,stranger ui,so true waiting for tenet to come out 
6120,6112,Hungry Jack's,you are not being realistic  people are loud i do not miss movies in the theater i rather watch in a home with less than  people total  cinemas will keep the business but they need to get used to the smaller numbers
6121,6113,rm1sha,you are correct movie theatres arent going anywhere no time soon by this time next yr covid will be mentioned in the likes of the flu cold etc etc
6122,6114,GLaDOS,just bring the bois in your house and watch
6123,6115,Kenneth Cooper,aweee that was sooo sweetlol
6124,6116,SmoothLegend,endgame set a new bar in that department of social masterpiece
6125,6117,frank234561,fuck that other movie goers fuck up my experience talking through it walking in front of me blocking my veiw loud kids obnoxious laughter etc i dont want any of that shit ill watch it at home in my own space and actually enjoy it
6126,6118,Peter Kim,movie theaters were nice until they started jacking up the prices amenities and just became too fancy  i dont want to spend  to get reserve seating then spend another  just for snacks  the fact that they wouldnt also let you bring in your own food or drink from dinner perhaps before the movie also ruined it for me
6127,6119,PSYCHO, saggar theres a difference between being cautious and living in fear
6128,6120,PSYCHO, seinfeld blockbuster dug their own grave by not adaptingbrbrnetflix destroyed them
6129,6121,PSYCHO, pugh but you can definitely catch an std pregnancy etc
6130,6122,PSYCHO, talents this quotimpactquot you speak of started in  when the iphone launchedbrbrever since then kids now grow up with smartphone screens and tablets the quotimpactquot on society has already happened before coronavirus came along you can go on any train or bus and youll see most people watching something on their phones
6131,6123,1RN19EI004, kim in my country a non imax movie costs u between  dollars to  dollars on any normal day  the pricing of the snacks is true for us even i dont understand why a bucket of pop corn costs u like  dollars and a whole fresh corn from the farm costs u less than  cents
6132,6124,PSYCHO, kim amc theaters dont search bags ive brought my bookbag filled with a liter soda and  bags of chips and cookies and candy for less than  totalbrmy friend brings chinese food in his bookbagbrbrthe snacks food and drinks that theaters sell is what pays the rent for them every month the studios get most of the ticket profitsbrbr ticket prices arent because of being able to reserve seats price is determined by the neighborhood where the theater is located at and its determined by inflation  million budget  years ago is worth more than a  million dollar budget in brbrthere are also cheap independent  theaters in some areas amc has  tuesdays if you make a free account
6133,6125,Ben Jammin,if drive came out in theaters and released simultaneously on netflix id pay to hit the theater no doubt i dont care if i go alone im looking for an experience
6134,6126,frank234561, kim you are spot on about the snacks you know the theater business model is fucked when concessions is how these theaters make their money movie studios no longer need these overpriced glorified snack stands to be their middleman anymore
6135,6127,R Menon, that would be   and a vaccine by 
6136,6128,I'M THE MAN,dont forget hooking up
6137,6129,I'M THE MAN, pugh i prefer movie theater and chill 
6138,6130,I'M THE MAN, karakaew um wednesdays during the day just sneak in and your good and hooking up is also better at the theater
6139,6131,I'M THE MAN, jacks you are so unamerican shame on you
6140,6132,Mark Pugh,m the man good for you
6141,6133,I'M THE MAN, pugh thats ive done it before and its the best
6142,6134,Bibble The Alien,i too like to spend time with friends and dates not speaking for  hours in some uncomfortable chair
6143,6135,Mark Pugh, not when netflix and chill means you are alone just watching whatever is on netflix
6144,6136,WCCX, saggar  possible death the odds are so low that most people dont even have to worry about it over half the nyc deaths were from people aged  and older with preexisting conditions another  from people in the  age bracket with preexisting conditions as a percentage of the population the deaths are miniscule its time to dial back most of these restrictions at least for the vast majority of us
6145,6137,Aashley Saggar, not every one lives in us though
6146,6138,powerfist80,youd more than likely be the superspreader
6147,6139,blanchbacker,nah atmos by myself is better no smelly poors
6148,6140,Aashley Saggar,well watching a movie is expensive as a collection of em all is sold at equivalent to a theatre ticketbrthen for experience a person can set up hardware for a same experience like a  inch led is good with an immersive speaker set up which u will eventually set up in ur living room say for a console or other binge watching anywaysbrthat hardware can also be used for other various purposes and can also be sold after two years recouping some money backbrall this is going against the cinemas and then lastly expensive food inside theatres
6149,6141,DreaD,majority of consumers are lazy and it works best if producers would keep them lazy companies such as apple understand this principle the best and maximizes their gain by leveraging it
6150,6142,XVN Gaming,no hate but your mic at times is not clear
6151,6143,Brett McMaster,movie theatres are the next blockbuster everyone streams at home now
6152,6144,Drezzy EFTP,dont forget gamestop as well
6153,6145,Alan T,kids are the main driving force for theaters seems like anymore think of the money disneypixar flicks make
6154,6146,MARTINJW25,watching new films at home isnt the same compared to cinema
6155,6147,Zachery798,martinjw youre right its better to watch them at home
6156,6148,Phi Sx,no  popcorn tho
6157,6149,Sachin, sx true that
6158,6150,stryfetc1,im actually starting to prefer it no obnoxiously loud asswipes talking no kids acting crazyi can enjoy it from the comfort of my sofa with affordable snacks that i bought
6159,6151,Sachin, amen to that 
6160,6152,SYNEED, in germany no one is loud in cinema
6161,6153,Paul What,yeah its so much better
6162,6154,Paul What, because its empty
6163,6155,SYNEED, what nah our cinemas are going to open soon
6164,6156,bum krilla,i use a quot screen with an k hdr projector with a bad ass sound system i live in the sticks closest movie theater is  hours away and my setup out performs most movie theaters
6165,6157,Dre L.,if you have a theater in your home it is
6166,6158,GLaDOS,popcornsound and screen size are the only superior parts
6167,6159,Dean Flynn,my cinemagoing went highend a long time agoover  screenings businessclass recliner leather seats arranged in pairs and suitably distanced from other pairs waiting staff dressed in black serving cocktails and gourmet food ondemandbrbrif its worth having its worth paying for in the old world i did the above every couple of months and kept the experience selective and specialthe rest of the content i watched was consumed on smaller screens
6168,6160,Sam,dam thats the go i never done that
6169,6161,marlow.e ncna,i still like going to big screens 
6170,6162,PSYCHO, amc has dinein theaters in some locations the waiters bring your drinks and food to you inside the actual theater room during the movie
6171,6163,neoasura,too bad its not like that in my area i live near the ghetto and our theater is always having issues loud people throwing things people getting into fights cars broken into in the parking lot etcso it ruined the theater for me for good
6172,6164,Shimeih,theatres aint going anywhere at all numbers are going to lessen but theatres are here to stay you can see in places like asiabrhere in china cinemas are always filled up at any time of day even in the small city i live in heck theres even a theatre on my campus which is always packed even during school hours
6173,6165,The Last Dad on Earth,theres also a billion people over there
6174,6166,Shimeih, last dad on earth yeah
6175,6167,Aashley Saggar, hey its kinda off topicbrbut what are ur thoughts about the border tensions and the hate china is getting recently on global levelborder tensions with taiwan and india coronatrade disputes etcbrjust want ur side of opinion to know is our media credible enough
6176,6168,Shimeih, saggar honestly i know so little about those issues except for the coronavirus you wont hear of those issues in our news so i have to use a vpn to get outside news and for the past few months vpn connection hasnt really been great ive heard about the muslim issues and the india border dispute but also i keep in mind that some foreign news sources will escalate a story for clicks etc so i have to be careful brbri do try to keep up with the news and well i dont support any hate that goes on no matter what form but i do understand some of the people scared to speak out if anything is going on because of the consequences they will face all i can say is that china is very different landscape socially and we have to first understand the chinese in order to engage or take measures for change brbrhowever with the world getting more connected and people finally getting a platform to speak out from i do believe that change is coming not now but soon
6177,6169,Aashley Saggar, k thnx mate have a good day
6178,6170,Shimeih, saggar same to you
6179,6171,Srini,maybe  mm home theatre will be new normal
6180,6172,Srini, morris or k projectors like benq which offer good home theatre experiencebrwe have to adapt to the new normal unfortunately
6181,6173,Srini,i am missing imax 
6182,6174,HazelEyezFella D,that will be the first place i go if they return

6186,6178,PSYCHO,tenet in imax mm baby cant fucking waitbrbrbest movie of  hands down it just hasnt happened yet 
6187,6179,Tauqeer Ahmad,wheres in india you watched imax mm theatre  
6188,6180,Srini, ahmad hyderabad had  imax  watched interstellar on it  now its dead  corona
6189,6181,Millyonz 258,if you watch the documentary quotside by sidequot narrated by jesus youll understand why some directors fight to maintain the traditional quotfilmquot format aliveits like audio with the whole digital vs analogue workflow im an engineer so i know what im compromising going full digital as opposed to full analogueat the end of the day for me its about balance
6190,6182,Donald Allan,i think a lot of film companies after seeing the potential renting new releases on smart tvs via various apps are going to change their minds about cinema     going forward film companies will say to cinemas that all new releases will not only be shown at the cinema but they can also be rented on tv at the same time
6191,6183,Víctor Mata,thats a brilliant and bright idea 
6192,6184,The Last Dad on Earth,id at least give a few days to a week between cinema release and digital streaming releasing it in theaters and digital on the same day is most likely going to kill cinema
6193,6185,Ruthwik Alamuru,haha theaters go brrr
6194,6186,HA Gamer,cinama will never go movies will always come to the cinama firstand that will make money some movies will be exclusive to cinama for long some will be less
6195,6187,Daniel Harvey IV,they are way too expensive too
6196,6188,TruBlacKing 85,i mean at the end of the day thats on the film company if they going to release in movie theaters in that cuz if they release in the movie theaters then you going to have to go and you dont have no choice but to if you want to see the latest movie
6197,6189,stryfetc1,  not entirely true people with jailbroken firesticks beg to differ
6198,6190,Y AB, bucks a ticket isnt expensive my g
6199,6191,stryfetc1, ab where you liveits like  in my city
6200,6192,Y AB, i dont live in the us but if you do currency conversion its about  dollars and  dollars for dolby cinema
6201,6193,Daniel Harvey IV, ab so its only  bucks a ticket where you live
6202,6194,Y AB, harvey iv yea im not sure why its so surprising to you
6203,6195,Daniel Harvey IV, ab  to  bucks where i live  bucks for small popcorn   bucks for small soda  too expensive if you have a family 
6204,6196,Y AB, harvey iv  bucks for a small popcorn thats brutal its  and a half bucks for a large popcorn where i live but the soda is accurate
6205,6197,Daniel Harvey IV, ab some places are even more expensive then that  and if you have a family  it can be  just to go to the movies one night
6206,6198,Y AB, harvey iv thats terrible man i honestly feel bad for you the cinema is considered a cheap night out for us here its a shame its not the same everywhere else
6207,6199,Daniel Harvey IV, ab where are you from if you dont mind me asking
6208,6200,Y AB, harvey iv middle east
6209,6201,Not A Destiny Gun,i could literally watch the hateful eight on netflix on my phone right now idk what they are talking about
6210,6202,Javier Moya,well the guy pitched tarantino to release it only for netlifx on iphonesno theatrical release period tarantino being tarantino would never opt for his movies to be released on a small screen before the silver screen especially since hes apparantly only making  movies
6211,6203,Not A Destiny Gun, moya when you say quotitquot do you mean the hateful eight and when you say on netflix but only on iphone that hurts my brain that makes no sense netflix and apple have no contracts lol any movie on netflix will be viewable on any device it will never be exclusive to iphone
6212,6204,Javier Moya, a destiny gun yes and not just iphones but i simplified the quoteexample to save time he wanted a purely mobile port for release and tarantino wasnt on board
6213,6205,Not A Destiny Gun, moya the hateful eight has been out for  years its been on netflix for  years or so why would it ever be rereleased on another port the argument here was whether or not films should be experienced on a cellphone thats already a possibility many films are directly released on streaming sites which are accessible through phones if i wanted too i could of watched the irishman on my phone at launch my point it a brand new port strictly for releases of new films is redundant the producers can sell those films straight to streaming sites and make tons more money than trying to port it through some other app this entire conversation is saturated in convolution
6214,6206,Charles Washington,carlos caracitas 
6215,6207,Gary Stinten, a destiny gun i would happily pay a theatre production company like  a year for all you can eat provided its all under the one app and i can pick by studio and movie if thats the case netflix and hulu and the rest would sink overnight
6216,6208,Ramesh Pal,make it the most liked comment ever
6217,6209,Ash Bayer,they probably wanted that as they knew it was going to clash with star wars release
6218,6210,Md Shariq,its stupid to think no one will go to theatres probably not now but once the vaccine comes people will flock to the theatres
6219,6211,Shimeih,but there wont really be a vaccine though just a damper but not a full vaccine
6220,6212,Shimeih, last dad on earth i know i was special talking about the vaccine i was just at a cinema a few days ago on my campus here in china things are kind of back to normal
6221,6213,Malik Abbas,nothing can replace theater experience
6222,6214,Shimeih,yes but i choose ott
6223,6215,ImGrenade,rip cinemas hahahaha
6224,6216,Higher Primate,ott bruh
6225,6217,Dalton Bush,movie theaters are changing for the best
6226,6218,Sam,yes but i was born in  think of how many times i have been to cinema as a kid so many memories man
6227,6219,Dalton Bush,yeah i  agree i never want movie theaters to go but the money and time at home
6228,6220,Mario Kart Fan,firstly i choose theaters over ott
6229,6221,Dashinglucifer,ott
6230,6222,Imaad Maqsood,wow theaters are really awesome bruh
