## OTT v/s THEATRES: Ensemble Model of Opinion Mining on Social Media
Opinion Mining (or Sentiment Analysis )has gained interest lately due to the uptick in social media.
People began expressing public and private outlooks on varied subjects and
sharing their perspectives on online forums. In this report, we concentrate on the
implementation of opinion classification with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
network with a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model.
Moreover, we present an ensemble model (LSTM-CNN) for opinion mining. This
paper reviews the public mindset towards the OTT platforms and Movie Theatre
with an LSTM-CNN ensemble model of Opinion Mining. Thus, Results
categorize users' viewpoints through comments into, “Ott biased” and “Movie
Theatre biased” illustrated in a pie chart.
